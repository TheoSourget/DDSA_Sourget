* Improve code to take in consideration OpenCitation Error 500
* Semi automated extraction with dimensions.ai
* Search for the reason some reference are missing for some sources
* Possible list of labels to classify paper's application
* Coverage comparison visualisation

## Who did you help this week ?
Show my code about OpenAlex and explained how it worked to Stinna Odgaard

## What helped you this week ?
* Ahmet Akkoc git (https://github.com/madprogramer/PublicDatasets) to get ideas for the csv and also the general organisation of a project at the ITU
* Article comparing multiple sources (https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11192-020-03690-4) Maybe outdated as it's from 2020
## What did you achieve ?
* Make the flowchart of the project (at res/flowchart_database.jpg)
* Create a first list of possible sources to use for extraction
* Extraction with OpenAlex, OpenCitation COCI, OpenCitation POCI
* Fusion of multiple sources
* Improved documentation of the project and code comments

## What did you struggle with ?
* Reference are not totally accurate in the APIs (sometimes some references are missing, sometimes it seems like there are also "false" references)
* OpenCitation API is "unstable" lot of crash leading to Error 500.
* No official API for google scholar
* Get the "Reference type" information from the API I use for the moment
* Not great result for paper with manual ground truth

## What would you like to work on next week ?
* Continue to improve reference extraction
* Maybe search for usage of kaggle datasets using (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaggle/meta-kaggle)
* Maybe try to use https://github.com/scholarly-python-package/scholarly for google scholar 

## Where do you need help from Veronika ?
* Check if current results and way of working are "right" 
* Confirm what to do next
