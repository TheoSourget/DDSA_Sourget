However, the existing segmentation methods do not attempt to reduce HD directly. In this paper, we present novel loss functions for training convolutional neural network (CNN)-based segmentation methods with the goal of reducing HD directly. We propose three methods to estimate HD from the segmentation probability map produced by a CNN. One method makes use of the distance transform of the segmentation boundary. Another method is based on applying morphological erosion on the difference between the true and estimated segmentation maps. The third method works by applying circular/spherical convolution kernels of different radii on the segmentation probability maps. Based on these three methods for estimating HD, we suggest three loss functions that can be used for training to reduce HD. We use these loss functions to train CNNs for segmentation of the prostate, liver, and pancreas in ultrasound, magnetic resonance, and computed tomography images and compare the results with commonly-used loss functions. Our results show that the proposed loss functions can lead to approximately 18-45% reduction in HD without degrading other segmentation performance criteria such as the Dice similarity coefficient. The proposed loss functions can be used for training medical image segmentation methods in order to reduce the large segmentation errors.","Thisworkwas supported in part by the Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC), in part by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), and in part by the Prostate Cancer Canada (PCC).

2461,pub.1117739643,10.1016/j.cmpb.2019.07.002,31416559,,Automated pancreas segmentation from computed tomography and magnetic resonance images: A systematic review,"The pancreas is a highly variable organ, the size, shape, and position of which are affected by age, sex, adiposity, the presence of diseases affecting the pancreas (e.g., diabetes, pancreatic cancer, pancreatitis) and other factors. Accurate automated segmentation of the pancreas has the potential to facilitate timely diagnosing and managing of diseases of the endocrine and exocrine pancreas. The aim was to systematically review studies reporting on automated pancreas segmentation algorithms derived from computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance (MR) images. The MEDLINE database and three patent databases were searched. Data on the performance of algorithms were meta-analysed, when possible. The algorithms were classified into one of four groups: multiorgan atlas-based, landmark-based, shape model-based, and neural network-based. A total of 13 cohorts suitable for meta-analysis were pooled to determine the performance of pancreas segmentation algorithms altogether using the Dice coefficient. These cohorts, comprising 1110 individuals, yielded a weighted mean Dice coefficient of 74.4%. Eight cohorts suitable for meta-analysis were pooled to determine the performance of pancreas segmentation algorithms altogether using the Jaccard index. These cohorts, comprising 636 individuals, yielded a weighted mean Jaccard index of 63.7%. Multiorgan atlas-based algorithms had a weighted mean Dice coefficient of 70.1% and a weighted mean Jaccard index of 59.8%. Neural network-based algorithms had a weighted mean Dice coefficient of 82.3% and a weighted mean Jaccard index of 70.1%. Studies using the other two types of algorithms were not meta-analysable. The above findings indicate that the automation of pancreas segmentation represents a considerable challenge as the performance of current automated pancreas segmentation algorithms is suboptimal. Adopting standardised reporting on performance of pancreas segmentation algorithms and encouraging the use of benchmark pancreas segmentation datasets will allow future algorithms to be tested and compared more easily and fairly.","This study was part of the COSMOS program.

Diagnosing and manually segmenting tumors are time-consuming clinical tasks, and success strongly depends on the doctor's experience. Automatic quantitative analysis and accurate segmentation of brain tumors are greatly needed for cancer diagnosis. Methods:This paper presents an advanced three-dimensional multimodal segmentation algorithm called nested dilation networks (NDNs). It is inspired by the U-Net architecture, a convolutional neural network (CNN) developed for biomedical image segmentation and is modified to achieve better performance for brain tumor segmentation. Thus, we propose residual blocks nested with dilations (RnD) in the encoding part to enrich the low-level features and use squeeze-and-excitation (SE) blocks in both the encoding and decoding parts to boost significant features. To prove the reliability of the network structure, we compare our results with those of the standard U-Net and its transmutation networks. Different loss functions are considered to cope with class imbalance problems to maximize the brain tumor segmentation results. A cascade training strategy is employed to run NDNs for coarse-to-fine tumor segmentation. This strategy decomposes the multiclass segmentation problem into three binary segmentation problems and trains each task sequentially. Various augmentation techniques are utilized to increase the diversity of the data to avoid overfitting. Results: This approach achieves Dice similarity scores of 0.6652, 0.5880, and 0.6682 for edema, non-enhancing tumors, and enhancing tumors, respectively, in which the Dice loss is used for single-pass training. After cascade training, the Dice similarity scores rise to 0.7043, 0.5889, and 0.7206, respectively. Conclusion: Experiments show that the proposed deep learning algorithm outperforms other U-Net transmutation networks for brain tumor segmentation. Moreover, applying cascade training to NDNs facilitates better performance than other methods. The findings of this study provide considerable insight into the automatic and accurate segmentation of brain tumors.",,"Funding.

architecture it quickly evolved to a commonly used benchmark in medical image
segmentation. The adaptation of the U-Net to novel problems, however, comprises
several degrees of freedom regarding the exact architecture, preprocessing,

substantially impact the overall performance. The present paper introduces the
nnU-Net ('no-new-Net'), which refers to a robust and self-adapting framework on
the basis of 2D and 3D vanilla U-Nets. We argue the strong case for taking away
superfluous bells and whistles of many proposed network designs and instead
focus on the remaining aspects that make out the performance and
generalizability of a method. We evaluate the nnU-Net in the context of the
Medical Segmentation Decathlon challenge, which measures segmentation
performance in ten disciplines comprising distinct entities, image modalities,
image geometries and dataset sizes, with no manual adjustments between datasets
allowed. At the time of manuscript submission, nnU-Net achieves the highest

architecture to different datasets and segmentation tasks. Without manual
tuning, nnU-Net surpasses most specialised deep learning pipelines in 19 public

adaptation of deep learning methods to different datasets. We make nnU-Net

models to solve highly specific tasks. To maximize performance, it is standard
practice to evaluate numerous pipelines with varying model topologies,
optimization parameters, pre- & postprocessing steps, and even model cascades.
It is often not clear how the resulting pipeline transfers to different tasks.
We propose a simple and thoroughly evaluated deep learning framework for
segmentation of arbitrary medical image volumes. The system requires no
task-specific information, no human interaction and is based on a fixed model
topology and a fixed hyperparameter set, eliminating the process of model
selection and its inherent tendency to cause method-level over-fitting. The
system is available in open source and does not require deep learning expertise
to use. Without task-specific modifications, the system performed better than
or similar to highly specialized deep learning methods across 3 separate
segmentation tasks. In addition, it ranked 5-th and 6-th in the first and
second round of the 2018 Medical Segmentation Decathlon comprising another 10
tasks. The system relies on multi-planar data augmentation which facilitates
the application of a single 2D architecture based on the familiar U-Net.
Multi-planar training combines the parameter efficiency of a 2D fully

computer assisted intervention and diagnosis methods. In recent years,
convolutional neural networks have dominated the state of the art in this task.
However, since this problem presents a challenging environment due to high
variability in the organ's shape and similarity between tissues, the generation
of false negative and false positive regions in the output segmentation is a
common issue. Recent works have shown that the uncertainty analysis of the
model can provide us with useful information about potential errors in the
segmentation. In this context, we proposed a segmentation refinement method
based on uncertainty analysis and graph convolutional networks. We employ the
uncertainty levels of the convolutional network in a particular input volume to
formulate a semi-supervised graph learning problem that is solved by training a
graph convolutional network. To test our method we refine the initial output of
a 2D U-Net. We validate our framework with the NIH pancreas dataset and the
spleen dataset of the medical segmentation decathlon. We show that our method
outperforms the state-of-the art CRF refinement method by improving the dice
score by 1% for the pancreas and 2% for spleen, with respect to the original

usually require large amounts of labeled data for training which are expensive
to collect in many applications, especially in the medical domain. Unlabeled
data, on the other hand, is much more abundant. Semi-supervised learning
techniques, such as co-training, could provide a powerful tool to leverage
unlabeled data. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, uncertainty-aware
multi-view co-training (UMCT), to address semi-supervised learning on 3D data,
such as volumetric data from medical imaging. In our work, co-training is
achieved by exploiting multi-viewpoint consistency of 3D data. We generate
different views by rotating or permuting the 3D data and utilize asymmetrical
3D kernels to encourage diversified features in different sub-networks. In
addition, we propose an uncertainty-weighted label fusion mechanism to estimate
the reliability of each view's prediction with Bayesian deep learning. As one
view requires the supervision from other views in co-training, our
self-adaptive approach computes a confidence score for the prediction of each
unlabeled sample in order to assign a reliable pseudo label. Thus, our approach
can take advantage of unlabeled data during training. We show the effectiveness
of our proposed semi-supervised method on several public datasets from medical
image segmentation tasks (NIH pancreas & LiTS liver tumor dataset). Meanwhile,
a fully-supervised method based on our approach achieved state-of-the-art

semi-automated or fully-automated. Manual segmentation offers full control over

deliver sub-optimal results without providing users with the means to make

To maximize performance, it is standard practice to evaluate numerous pipelines with varying model topologies, optimization parameters, pre- & postprocessing steps, and even model cascades. It is often not clear how the resulting pipeline transfers to different tasks.We propose a simple and thoroughly evaluated deep learning framework for segmentation of arbitrary medical image volumes. The system requires no task-specific information, no human interaction and is based on a fixed model topology and a fixed hyperparameter set, eliminating the process of model selection and its inherent tendency to cause method-level over-fitting. The system is available in open source and does not require deep learning expertise to use. Without task-specific modifications, the system performed better than or similar to highly specialized deep learning methods across 3 separate segmentation tasks. In addition, it ranked 5-th and 6-th in the first and second round of the 2018 Medical Segmentation Decathlon comprising another 10 tasks.The system relies on multi-planar data augmentation which facilitates the application of a single 2D architecture based on the familiar U-Net.

segmentation methods. However, existing segmentation methods do not attempt to
reduce HD directly. In this paper, we present novel loss functions for training
convolutional neural network (CNN)-based segmentation methods with the goal of
reducing HD directly. We propose three methods to estimate HD from the
segmentation probability map produced by a CNN. One method makes use of the
distance transform of the segmentation boundary. Another method is based on
applying morphological erosion on the difference between the true and estimated
segmentation maps. The third method works by applying circular/spherical
convolution kernels of different radii on the segmentation probability maps.
Based on these three methods for estimating HD, we suggest three loss functions
that can be used for training to reduce HD. We use these loss functions to
train CNNs for segmentation of the prostate, liver, and pancreas in ultrasound,
magnetic resonance, and computed tomography images and compare the results with
commonly-used loss functions. Our results show that the proposed loss functions
can lead to approximately 18-45 % reduction in HD without degrading other

proposed loss functions can be used for training medical image segmentation

applied to several tasks including image segmentation, intra-operative
tracking, multi-modal image alignment, and motion analysis. Popular
registration tools such as ANTs and NiftyReg optimize an objective function for
each pair of images from scratch which is time-consuming for large images with
complicated deformation. Facilitated by the rapid progress of deep learning,
learning-based approaches such as VoxelMorph have been emerging for image
registration. These approaches can achieve competitive performance in a
fraction of a second on advanced GPUs. In this work, we construct a neural
registration framework, called NeurReg, with a hybrid loss of displacement
fields and data similarity, which substantially improves the current
state-of-the-art of registrations. Within the framework, we simulate various
transformations by a registration simulator which generates fixed image and
displacement field ground truth for training. Furthermore, we design three
segmentation frameworks based on the proposed registration framework: 1)
atlas-based segmentation, 2) joint learning of both segmentation and
registration tasks, and 3) multi-task learning with atlas-based segmentation as
an intermediate feature. Extensive experimental results validate the
effectiveness of the proposed NeurReg framework based on various metrics: the
endpoint error (EPE) of the predicted displacement field, mean square error
(MSE), normalized local cross-correlation (NLCC), mutual information (MI), Dice
coefficient, uncertainty estimation, and the interpretability of the
segmentation. The proposed NeurReg improves registration accuracy with fast

performance of these methods when applied to out-of-centre data.
  We trained two state-of-the-art fully convolutional CNN architectures on the

raters: a reference implementation of a 3D Unet, and a more recently proposed
3D-to-2D architecture (DeepSCAN). We then retrained those methods on a larger

structures. We quantified changes in performance owing to dataset shift, and
changes in performance by adding the additional brain-structure labels. We also
compared performance with freely available reference methods.
  Both fully-convolutional CNN methods substantially outperform other
approaches in the literature when trained and evaluated in cross-validation on
the MSSEG dataset, showing agreement with human raters in the range of human
inter-rater variability. Both architectures showed drops in performance when
trained on single-centre data and tested on the MSSEG dataset. When trained
with the addition of weak anatomical labels derived from Freesurfer, the

or 3D networks, where both pipelines have advantages and disadvantages. 2D
methods enjoy a low inference time and greater transfer-ability while 3D
methods are superior in performance for hard targets requiring contextual
information. This paper investigates efficient 3D segmentation from another
perspective, which uses 2D networks to mimic 3D segmentation. To compensate the
lack of contextual information in 2D manner, we propose to thicken the 2D
network inputs by feeding multiple slices as multiple channels into 2D networks
and thus 3D contextual information is incorporated. We also put forward to use
early-stage multiplexing and slice sensitive attention to solve the confusion
problem of information loss which occurs when 2D networks face thickened
inputs. With this design, we achieve a higher performance while maintaining a
lower inference latency on a few abdominal organs from CT scans, in particular
when the organ has a peculiar 3D shape and thus strongly requires contextual
information, demonstrating our method's effectiveness and ability in capturing
3D information. We also point out that ""thickened"" 2D inputs pave a new method
of 3D segmentation, and look forward to more efforts in this direction.

Existing approaches either applied multi-view planar (2D) networks or directly used volumetric (3D) networks for this purpose, but both of them are not ideal: 2D networks cannot capture 3D contexts effectively, and 3D networks are both memory-consuming and less stable arguably due to the lack of pre-trained models. In this paper, we bridge the gap between 2D and 3D using a novel approach named Elastic Boundary Projection (EBP). The key observation is that, although the object is a 3D volume, what we really need in segmentation is to find its boundary which is a 2D surface. Therefore, we place a number of pivot points in the 3D space, and for each pivot, we determine its distance to the object boundary along a dense set of directions. This creates an elastic shell around each pivot which is initialized as a perfect sphere. We train a 2D deep network to determine whether each ending point falls within the object, and gradually adjust the shell so that it gradually converges to the actual shape of the boundary and thus achieves the goal of segmentation. EBP allows boundary-based segmentation without cutting a 3D volume into slices or patches, which stands out from conventional 2D and 3D approaches. EBP achieves promising accuracy in abdominal organ segmentation.

578,pub.1119402770,10.48550/arxiv.1812.00518,,,Elastic Boundary Projection for 3D Medical Image Segmentation,"We focus on an important yet challenging problem: using a 2D deep network to
deal with 3D segmentation for medical image analysis. Existing approaches
either applied multi-view planar (2D) networks or directly used volumetric (3D)
networks for this purpose, but both of them are not ideal: 2D networks cannot
capture 3D contexts effectively, and 3D networks are both memory-consuming and
less stable arguably due to the lack of pre-trained models.
  In this paper, we bridge the gap between 2D and 3D using a novel approach
named Elastic Boundary Projection (EBP). The key observation is that, although
the object is a 3D volume, what we really need in segmentation is to find its
boundary which is a 2D surface. Therefore, we place a number of pivot points in
the 3D space, and for each pivot, we determine its distance to the object
boundary along a dense set of directions. This creates an elastic shell around
each pivot which is initialized as a perfect sphere. We train a 2D deep network
to determine whether each ending point falls within the object, and gradually
adjust the shell so that it gradually converges to the actual shape of the
boundary and thus achieves the goal of segmentation. EBP allows boundary-based
segmentation without cutting a 3D volume into slices or patches, which stands
out from conventional 2D and 3D approaches. EBP achieves promising accuracy in
abdominal organ segmentation. Our code has been open-sourced

gold standards"" of diagnostic medical imaging. The long acquisition times,
however, render MRI prone to motion artifacts, let alone their adverse
contribution to the relative high costs of MRI examination. Over the last few
decades, multiple studies have focused on the development of both physical and
post-processing methods for accelerated acquisition of MRI scans. These two
approaches, however, have so far been addressed separately. On the other hand,
recent works in optical computational imaging have demonstrated growing success
of concurrent learning-based design of data acquisition and image
reconstruction schemes. Such schemes have already demonstrated substantial
effectiveness, leading to considerably shorter acquisition times and improved
quality of image reconstruction. Inspired by this initial success, in this
work, we propose a novel approach to the learning of optimal schemes for
conjoint acquisition and reconstruction of MRI scans, with the optimization
carried out simultaneously with respect to the time-efficiency of data
acquisition and the quality of resulting reconstructions. To be of a practical
value, the schemes are encoded in the form of general k-space trajectories,
whose associated magnetic gradients are constrained to obey a set of predefined
hardware requirements (as defined in terms of, e.g., peak currents and maximum
slew rates of magnetic gradients). With this proviso in mind, we propose a
novel algorithm for the end-to-end training of a combined
acquisition-reconstruction pipeline using a deep neural network with
differentiable forward- and back-propagation operators. We demonstrate its
effectiveness on image reconstruction and image segmentation tasks, reporting
substantial improvements in terms of acceleration factors as well as the
quality of these tasks.",,,arXiv,,,2019-09-12,2019,,,,,,All OA, Green,Preprint,"Weiss, Tomer; Senouf, Ortal; Vedula, Sanketh; Michailovich, Oleg; Zibulevsky, Michael; Bronstein, Alex","Weiss, Tomer (); Senouf, Ortal (); Vedula, Sanketh (); Michailovich, Oleg (); Zibulevsky, Michael (); Bronstein, Alex ()",,"Weiss, Tomer (); Senouf, Ortal (); Vedula, Sanketh (); Michailovich, Oleg (); Zibulevsky, Michael (); Bronstein, Alex ()",1,1,,0.19,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1121015134,40 Engineering, 4003 Biomedical Engineering, 46 Information and Computing Sciences,,,,,,,,,
514,pub.1119413933,10.48550/arxiv.1906.02849,,,Multi-scale self-guided attention for medical image segmentation,"Even though convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are driving progress in
medical image segmentation, standard models still have some drawbacks. First,
the use of multi-scale approaches, i.e., encoder-decoder architectures, leads
to a redundant use of information, where similar low-level features are
extracted multiple times at multiple scales. Second, long-range feature
dependencies are not efficiently modeled, resulting in non-optimal
discriminative feature representations associated with each semantic class. In
this paper we attempt to overcome these limitations with the proposed
architecture, by capturing richer contextual dependencies based on the use of
guided self-attention mechanisms. This approach is able to integrate local
features with their corresponding global dependencies, as well as highlight
interdependent channel maps in an adaptive manner. Further, the additional loss
between different modules guides the attention mechanisms to neglect irrelevant
information and focus on more discriminant regions of the image by emphasizing
relevant feature associations. We evaluate the proposed model in the context of
semantic segmentation on three different datasets: abdominal organs,
cardiovascular structures and brain tumors. A series of ablation experiments
support the importance of these attention modules in the proposed architecture.
In addition, compared to other state-of-the-art segmentation networks our model
yields better segmentation performance, increasing the accuracy of the
predictions while reducing the standard deviation. This demonstrates the
efficiency of our approach to generate precise and reliable automatic
segmentations of medical images. Our code is made publicly available at

421,pub.1123311564,10.48550/arxiv.1912.05396,,,Multimodal Self-Supervised Learning for Medical Image Analysis,"Self-supervised learning approaches leverage unlabeled samples to acquire
generic knowledge about different concepts, hence allowing for
annotation-efficient downstream task learning. In this paper, we propose a
novel self-supervised method that leverages multiple imaging modalities. We
introduce the multimodal puzzle task, which facilitates rich representation
learning from multiple image modalities. The learned representations allow for
subsequent fine-tuning on different downstream tasks. To achieve that, we learn
a modality-agnostic feature embedding by confusing image modalities at the
data-level. Together with the Sinkhorn operator, with which we formulate the
puzzle solving optimization as permutation matrix inference instead of
classification, they allow for efficient solving of multimodal puzzles with
varying levels of complexity. In addition, we also propose to utilize
cross-modal generation techniques for multimodal data augmentation used for
training self-supervised tasks. In other words, we exploit synthetic images for
self-supervised pretraining, instead of downstream tasks directly, in order to
circumvent quality issues associated with synthetic images, while improving
data-efficiency and representations quality. Our experimental results, which
assess the gains in downstream performance and data-efficiency, show that
solving our multimodal puzzles yields better semantic representations, compared
to treating each modality independently. Our results also highlight the
benefits of exploiting synthetic images for self-supervised pretraining. We
showcase our approach on four downstream tasks: Brain tumor segmentation and
survival days prediction using four MRI modalities, Prostate segmentation using
two MRI modalities, and Liver segmentation using unregistered CT and MRI
modalities. We outperform many previous solutions, and achieve results
competitive to state-of-the-art.",,,arXiv,,,2019-12-11,2019,,,,,,All OA, Green,Preprint,"Taleb, Aiham; Lippert, Christoph; Klein, Tassilo; Nabi, Moin","Taleb, Aiham (); Lippert, Christoph (); Klein, Tassilo (); Nabi, Moin ()",,"Taleb, Aiham (); Lippert, Christoph (); Klein, Tassilo (); Nabi, Moin ()",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1123311564,46 Information and Computing Sciences, 4603 Computer Vision and Multimedia Computation, 4611 Machine Learning,,,,,,,,,

Unlike other organs, the liver is the only organ with two sets of venous systems. Meanwhile, the segmentation target distribution in the hepatic vein scene is extremely unbalanced. The hepatic veins occupy a small area in abdominal CT slices. The morphology of each person's hepatic vein is different, which also makes segmentation difficult. The purpose of this study is to develop an automated hepatic vein segmentation model that guides clinical diagnosis.Approach.We introduce the 3D spatial distribution and density awareness (SDA) of hepatic veins and propose an automatic segmentation network based on 3D U-Net which includes a multi-axial squeeze and excitation module (MASE) and a distribution correction module (DCM). The MASE restrict the activation area to the area with hepatic veins. The DCM improves the awareness of the sparse spatial distribution of the hepatic veins. To obtain global axial information and spatial information at the same time, we study the effect of different training strategies on hepatic vein segmentation. Our method was evaluated by a public dataset and a private dataset. The Dice coefficient achieves 71.37% and 69.58%, improving 3.60% and 3.30% compared to the other SOTA models, respectively. Furthermore, metrics based on distance and volume also show the superiority of our method.Significance.The proposed method greatly reduced false positive areas and improved the segmentation performance of the hepatic vein in CT images.

For this, a 3D U-Net was trained on an in-house dataset (n = 61) including diseases with and without splenic involvement (in-house U-Net), and an open-source dataset from the Medical Segmentation Decathlon (open dataset, n = 61) without splenic abnormalities (open U-Net). Both datasets were split into a training (n = 32.52%), a validation (n = 9.15%) and a testing dataset (n = 20.33%). The segmentation performances of the two models were measured using four established metrics, including the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC). On the open test dataset, the in-house and open U-Net achieved a mean DSC of 0.906 and 0.897 respectively (p = 0.526). On the in-house test dataset, the in-house U-Net achieved a mean DSC of 0.941, whereas the open U-Net obtained a mean DSC of 0.648 (p < 0.001), showing very poor segmentation results in patients with abnormalities in or surrounding the spleen.

However, most methods are still designed for 2D medical images while ignoring the essential 3D volume information. The main challenge for 3D Transformer-based segmentation methods is the quadratic complexity introduced by the self-attention mechanism [17]. In this paper, we are addressing these two research gaps, lack of 3D methods and computational complexity in Transformers, by proposing a novel Transformer architecture that has an encoder-decoder style architecture with linear complexity. Furthermore, we newly introduce a dynamic token concept to further reduce the token numbers for self-attention calculation. Taking advantage of the global information modeling, we provide uncertainty maps from different hierarchy stages. We evaluate this method on multiple challenging CT pancreas segmentation datasets. Our results show that our novel 3D Transformer-based segmentor could provide promising highly feasible segmentation performance and accurate uncertainty quantification using single annotation.

However, existing CNNs are limited by the problem of dependency on the availability of training data owing to high manual annotation costs and privacy issues. To counter this limitation, domain adaptation (DA) and few-shot learning have been extensively studied. Inspired by these two categories of approaches, we propose an optimization-based meta-learning method for segmentation tasks. Even though existing meta-learning methods use prior knowledge to choose parameters that generalize well from few examples, these methods limit the diversity of the task distribution that they can learn from in medical image segmentation. In this paper, we propose a meta-learning algorithm to augment the existing algorithms with the capability to learn from diverse segmentation tasks across the entire task distribution. Specifically, our algorithm aims to learn from the diversity of image features which characterize a specific tissue type while showing diverse signal intensities. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, we conducted experiments using a diverse set of segmentation tasks from the Medical Segmentation Decathlon and two meta-learning benchmarks: model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) and Reptile.

Although segmentation is the most widely investigated medical image processing task, the various challenges have been organized to focus only on specific clinical tasks. We organized the Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD)—a biomedical image analysis challenge, in which algorithms compete in a multitude of both tasks and modalities to investigate the hypothesis that a method capable of performing well on multiple tasks will generalize well to a previously unseen task and potentially outperform a custom-designed solution. MSD results confirmed this hypothesis, moreover, MSD winner continued generalizing well to a wide range of other clinical problems for the next two years. Three main conclusions can be drawn from this study: (1) state-of-the-art image segmentation algorithms generalize well when retrained on unseen tasks; (2) consistent algorithmic performance across multiple tasks is a strong surrogate of algorithmic generalizability; (3) the training of accurate AI segmentation models is now commoditized to scientists that are not versed in AI model training.","This work was supported by the UK Research and Innovation London Medical Imaging &amp; Artificial Intelligence Center for Value-Based Healthcare.

This limits both reproducibility and comparability.
METHODS: Prostate158 consists of 158 expert annotated biparametric 3T prostate MRIs comprising T2w sequences and diffusion-weighted sequences with apparent diffusion coefficient maps. Two U-ResNets trained for segmentation of anatomy (central gland, peripheral zone) and suspicious lesions for prostate cancer (PCa) with a PI-RADS score of ≥4 served as baseline algorithms. Segmentation performance was evaluated using the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), the Hausdorff distance (HD), and the average surface distance (ASD). The Wilcoxon test with Bonferroni correction was used to evaluate differences in performance. The generalizability of the baseline model was assessed using the open datasets Medical Segmentation Decathlon and PROSTATEx.
RESULTS: Compared to Reader 1, the models achieved a DSC/HD/ASD of 0.88/18.3/2.2 for the central gland, 0.75/22.8/1.9 for the peripheral zone, and 0.45/36.7/17.4 for PCa. Compared with Reader 2, the DSC/HD/ASD were 0.88/17.5/2.6 for the central gland, 0.73/33.2/1.9 for the peripheral zone, and 0.4/39.5/19.1 for PCa. Interrater agreement measured in DSC/HD/ASD was 0.87/11.1/1.0 for the central gland, 0.75/15.8/0.74 for the peripheral zone, and 0.6/18.8/5.5 for PCa. Segmentation performances on the Medical Segmentation Decathlon and PROSTATEx were 0.82/22.5/3.4; 0.86/18.6/2.5 for the central gland, and 0.64/29.2/4.7; 0.71/26.3/2.2 for the peripheral zone.
CONCLUSIONS: We provide an openly accessible, expert-annotated 3T dataset of prostate MRI and a reproducible benchmark to foster the development of prostate segmentation algorithms.","LCA is grateful for her participation in the BIH Charité–Junior Clinician and Clinician Scientist Program and KKB is grateful for his participation in the BIH Charité Digital Clinician Scientist Program, all funded by the Charité–Universitätsmedizin Berlin and the Berlin Institute of Health.",,Computers in Biology and Medicine,,Algorithms, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Prostate, Prostatic Neoplasms, Reproducibility of Results, Retrospective Studies,2022-07-11,2022,2022-07-11,2022-09,148,,105817,Closed,Article,"Adams, Lisa C; Makowski, Marcus R; Engel, Günther; Rattunde, Maximilian; Busch, Felix; Asbach, Patrick; Niehues, Stefan M; Vinayahalingam, Shankeeth; van Ginneken, Bram; Litjens, Geert; Bressem, Keno K","Adams, Lisa C (Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Corporate Member of Freie Universität Berlin and Humboldt Universität zu Berlin, Institute for Radiology, Luisenstraße 7, 10117, Hindenburgdamm 30, 12203, Berlin, Germany; Berlin Institute of Health at Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Charitéplatz 1, 10117, Berlin, Germany.

This is especially important in medical imaging tasks but one metric is usually compromised for the other. To address this problem, this paper presents an extremely fast, small and computationally effective deep neural network called Stripped-Down UNet (SD-UNet), designed for the segmentation of biomedical data on devices with limited computational resources. By making use of depthwise separable convolutions in the entire network, we design a lightweight deep convolutional neural network architecture inspired by the widely adapted U-Net model. In order to recover the expected performance degradation in the process, we introduce a weight standardization algorithm with the group normalization method. We demonstrate that SD-UNet has three major advantages including: (i) smaller model size (23x smaller than U-Net); (ii) 8x fewer parameters; and (iii) faster inference time with a computational complexity lower than 8M floating point operations (FLOPs). Experiments on the benchmark dataset of the Internatioanl Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic (EM) stacks and the Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD) challenge brain tumor segmentation (BRATs) dataset show that the proposed model achieves comparable and sometimes better results compared to the current state-of-the-art.",,"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (61876010, 61806013, 61906005); Chaoyang Postdoctoral Foundation of Beijing (2019zz-35).",Diagnostics,,,2020-02-18,2020,2020-02-18,,10,2,110,All OA, Gold,Article,"Gadosey, Pius Kwao; Li, Yujian; Agyekum, Enock Adjei; Zhang, Ting; Liu, Zhaoying; Yamak, Peter T.; Essaf, Firdaous","Gadosey, Pius Kwao (Faculty of Information Technology, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing 100124, China;, zhangting@bjut.edu.cn, (T.Z.);, zhaoying.liu@bjut.edu.cn, (Z.L.);, peteryamak@emails.bjut.edu.cn, (P.T.Y.);, firdaous.essaf@emails.bjut.edu.cn, (F.E.)); Li, Yujian (School of Artificial Intelligence, Guilin University of Electronic Technology, Guilin 541004, China;, liyujian@guet.edu.cn); Agyekum, Enock Adjei (College of Life Science and Bioengineering, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing 100124, China;, enockagyekum3@emails.bjut.edu.cn); Zhang, Ting (Faculty of Information Technology, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing 100124, China;, zhangting@bjut.edu.cn, (T.Z.);, zhaoying.liu@bjut.edu.cn, (Z.L.);, peteryamak@emails.bjut.edu.cn, (P.T.Y.);, firdaous.essaf@emails.bjut.edu.cn, (F.E.)); Liu, Zhaoying (Faculty of Information Technology, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing 100124, China;, zhangting@bjut.edu.cn, (T.Z.);, zhaoying.liu@bjut.edu.cn, (Z.L.);, peteryamak@emails.bjut.edu.cn, (P.T.Y.);, firdaous.essaf@emails.bjut.edu.cn, (F.E.)); Yamak, Peter T.

However, deep learning models are not trusted in the clinical routine due to failing silently on out-of-distribution (OOD) data. We propose a lightweight OOD detection method that leverages the Mahalanobis distance in the feature space and seamlessly integrates into state-of-the-art segmentation pipelines. The simple approach can even augment pre-trained models with clinically relevant uncertainty quantification. We validate our method across four chest CT distribution shifts and two magnetic resonance imaging applications, namely segmentation of the hippocampus and the prostate. Our results show that the proposed method effectively detects far- and near-OOD samples across all explored scenarios.","This work was supported by the RACOON network under BMBF, Germany grant number [01KX2021]; and the Bundesministerium für Gesundheit (BMG), Germany with grant [ZMVI1-2520DAT03A].",,Medical Image Analysis,,"Humans; Male; COVID-19; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Lung Diseases; Lung",2022-08-24,2022,2022-08-24,2022-11,82,,102596,All OA, Bronze,Article,"González, Camila; Gotkowski, Karol; Fuchs, Moritz; Bucher, Andreas; Dadras, Armin; Fischbach, Ricarda; Kaltenborn, Isabel Jasmin; Mukhopadhyay, Anirban","González, Camila (Darmstadt University of Technology, Karolinenplatz 5, 64289 Darmstadt, Germany.

While the number of these international competitions is steadily increasing, surprisingly little effort has been invested in ensuring high quality design, execution and reporting for these international competitions. Specifically, results analysis and visualization in the event of uncertainties have been given almost no attention in the literature. Given these shortcomings, the contribution of this paper is two-fold: (1) we present a set of methods to comprehensively analyze and visualize the results of single-task and multi-task challenges and apply them to a number of simulated and real-life challenges to demonstrate their specific strengths and weaknesses; (2) we release the open-source framework challengeR as part of this work to enable fast and wide adoption of the methodology proposed in this paper.

Such data cannot be procured without consideration for patient privacy, mandated both by legal regulations and ethical requirements of the medical profession. Differential privacy (DP) enables the provision of information-theoretic privacy guarantees to patients and can be implemented in the setting of deep neural network training through the differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) algorithm. We here present deepee, a free-and-open-source framework for differentially private deep learning for use with the PyTorch deep learning framework. Our framework is based on parallelised execution of neural network operations to obtain and modify the per-sample gradients. The process is efficiently abstracted via a data structure maintaining shared memory references to neural network weights to maintain memory efficiency. We furthermore offer specialised data loading procedures and privacy budget accounting based on the Gaussian Differential Privacy framework, as well as automated modification of the user-supplied neural network architectures to ensure DP-conformity of its layers. We benchmark our framework’s computational performance against other open-source DP frameworks and evaluate its application on the paediatric pneumonia dataset, an image classification task and on the Medical Segmentation Decathlon Liver dataset in the task of medical image segmentation. We find that neural network training with rigorous privacy guarantees is possible while maintaining acceptable classification performance and excellent segmentation performance. Our framework compares favourably to related work with respect to memory consumption and computational performance. Our work presents an open-source software framework for differentially private deep learning, which we demonstrate in medical imaging analysis tasks. It serves to further the utilisation of privacy-enhancing techniques in medicine and beyond in order to assist researchers and practitioners in addressing the numerous outstanding challenges towards their widespread implementation.",This work was supported by the UK Research and Innovation London Medical Imaging &amp, Artificial Intelligence Centre for Value Based Healthcare (G.K. and D.R.) and the Technical University Munich/Imperial College London Joint Academy of Doctoral Studies (D.U.).,Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.,Scientific Reports,,,2021-06-29,2021,2021-06-29,,11,1,13524,All OA, Gold,Article,"Ziller, Alexander; Usynin, Dmitrii; Braren, Rickmer; Makowski, Marcus; Rueckert, Daniel; Kaissis, Georgios","Ziller, Alexander (Institute for Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology, Klinikum rechts der Isar, School of Medicine, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany; Artificial Intelligence in Medicine and Healthcare, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany; OpenMined, Oxford, UK); Usynin, Dmitrii (Institute for Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology, Klinikum rechts der Isar, School of Medicine, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany; Artificial Intelligence in Medicine and Healthcare, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany; Department of Computing, Imperial College, London, UK; OpenMined, Oxford, UK); Braren, Rickmer (Institute for Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology, Klinikum rechts der Isar, School of Medicine, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany); Makowski, Marcus (Institute for Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology, Klinikum rechts der Isar, School of Medicine, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany); Rueckert, Daniel (Artificial Intelligence in Medicine and Healthcare, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany; Department of Computing, Imperial College, London, UK); Kaissis, Georgios (Institute for Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology, Klinikum rechts der Isar, School of Medicine, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany; Artificial Intelligence in Medicine and Healthcare, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany; Department of Computing, Imperial College, London, UK; OpenMined, Oxford, UK)","Kaissis, Georgios (Rechts der Isar Hospital; Technical University of Munich; Technical University of Munich; Imperial College London; )","Ziller, Alexander (Rechts der Isar Hospital; Technical University of Munich; Technical University of Munich); Usynin, Dmitrii (Rechts der Isar Hospital; Technical University of Munich; Technical University of Munich; Imperial College London); Braren, Rickmer (Rechts der Isar Hospital; Technical University of Munich); Makowski, Marcus (Rechts der Isar Hospital; Technical University of Munich); Rueckert, Daniel (Technical University of Munich; Imperial College London); Kaissis, Georgios (Rechts der Isar Hospital; Technical University of Munich; Technical University of Munich; Imperial College London)",28,28,1.25,22.92,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-93030-0.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1139216682,46 Information and Computing Sciences, 4611 Machine Learning,,,,,,,,,

The central motivation of this work is to provide a fair comparison of U-Net and its five extensions using identical conditions to disentangle the influence of model architecture, model training, and parameter settings on the performance of a trained model. For this purpose each of these six segmentation architectures is trained on the same nine data sets. The data sets are selected to cover various imaging modalities (X-rays, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging), single- and multi-class segmentation problems, and single- and multi-modal inputs. During the training, it is ensured that the data preprocessing, data set split into training, validation, and testing subsets, optimizer, learning rate change strategy, architecture depth, loss function, supervision and inference are exactly the same for all the architectures compared. Performance is evaluated in terms of Dice coefficient, surface Dice coefficient, average surface distance, Hausdorff distance, training, and prediction time. The main contribution of this experimental study is demonstrating that the architecture variants do not improve the quality of inference related to the basic U-Net architecture while resource demand rises.","The authors acknowledge the National Cancer Institute and the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health, and their critical role in the creation of the free publicly available LIDC/IDRI Database used in this study.","This work was supported by the PLGrid Infrastructure [Academic Computer Centre (ACC) Cyfronet Akademia Górniczo-Hutnicza (AGH)].

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown promise in image analysis, but the networks' potential for pancreatic cancer detection and diagnosis is unclear. We aimed to investigate whether CNN could distinguish individuals with and without pancreatic cancer on CT, compared with radiologist interpretation.
METHODS: In this retrospective, diagnostic study, contrast-enhanced CT images of 370 patients with pancreatic cancer and 320 controls from a Taiwanese centre were manually labelled and randomly divided for training and validation (295 patients with pancreatic cancer and 256 controls) and testing (75 patients with pancreatic cancer and 64 controls; local test set 1). Images were preprocessed into patches, and a CNN was trained to classify patches as cancerous or non-cancerous. Individuals were classified as with or without pancreatic cancer on the basis of the proportion of patches diagnosed as cancerous by the CNN, using a cutoff determined using the training and validation set. The CNN was further tested with another local test set (101 patients with pancreatic cancers and 88 controls; local test set 2) and a US dataset (281 pancreatic cancers and 82 controls). Radiologist reports of pancreatic cancer images in the local test sets were retrieved for comparison.
FINDINGS: Between Jan 1, 2006, and Dec 31, 2018, we obtained CT images. In local test set 1, CNN-based analysis had a sensitivity of 0·973, specificity of 1·000, and accuracy of 0·986 (area under the curve [AUC] 0·997 (95% CI 0·992-1·000). In local test set 2, CNN-based analysis had a sensitivity of 0·990, specificity of 0·989, and accuracy of 0·989 (AUC 0·999 [0·998-1·000]). In the US test set, CNN-based analysis had a sensitivity of 0·790, specificity of 0·976, and accuracy of 0·832 (AUC 0·920 [0·891-0·948)]. CNN-based analysis achieved higher sensitivity than radiologists did (0·983 vs 0·929, difference 0·054 [95% CI 0·011-0·098]; p=0·014) in the two local test sets combined. CNN missed three (1·7%) of 176 pancreatic cancers (1·1-1·2 cm). Radiologists missed 12 (7%) of 168 pancreatic cancers (1·0-3·3 cm), of which 11 (92%) were correctly classified using CNN. The sensitivity of CNN for tumours smaller than 2 cm was 92·1% in the local test sets and 63·1% in the US test set.
INTERPRETATION: CNN could accurately distinguish pancreatic cancer on CT, with acceptable generalisability to images of patients from various races and ethnicities. CNN could supplement radiologist interpretation.

To assist doctors in analyzing the shape and volume of the hippocampus, an accurate and automatic hippocampus segmentation method is highly demanded in the clinical practice. Given that fully convolutional networks (FCNs) have made significant contributions in biomedical image segmentation applications, we propose a notably discriminative feature network based on a hierarchical attention mechanism in hippocampal segmentation. First, considering the problem that the hippocampus is a rather small part in MR images, we design a context-aware high-level feature extraction module (CHFEM) to extract high-level features of scale invariance in the encoder stage. Further, we introduce a hierarchical attention mechanism into our segmentation framework. The mechanism is divided into three parts: a low-level feature spatial attention module (LFSAM) is developed to learn the spatial relationship between different pixels on each channel in the low-level stage of the encoder, a high-level feature channel attention module (HFCAM) is to model the semantic information relationship on different channel images in the high-level stage of the encoder, and a cross-connected attention module (CCAM) is designed in the decoder part to further suppress the noisy boundaries of hippocampus and simultaneously utilize the attentional low-level features from the encoder to better guide the high-level hippocampus edge segmentation in the decoder phase. The proposed approach achieves outstanding performance on the ADNI dataset and the Decathlon dataset compared with other semantic segmentation models and existing hippocampal segmentation approaches.

Most of existing medical image segmentation solutions adopt convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Althought these existing solutions can achieve good image segmentation performance, CNNs focus on local information and ignore global image information. Since Transformer can encode the whole image, it has good global modeling ability and is effective for the extraction of global information. Therefore, this paper proposes a hybrid feature extraction network, into which CNNs and Transformer are integrated to utilize their advantages in feature extraction. To enhance low-dimensional texture features, this paper also proposes a multi-dimensional statistical feature extraction module to fully fuse the features extracted by CNNs and Transformer and enhance the segmentation performance of medical images.

The U-Net architecture, either 2D or 3D, has already been shown to be effective at addressing the segmentation problem in breast MRI. However, the lack of publicly available datasets for this task has forced several authors to rely on internal datasets composed of either acquisitions without fat suppression (WOFS) or with fat suppression (FS), limiting the generalization of the approach. To solve this problem, we propose a data-centric approach, efficiently using the data available. By collecting a dataset of T1-weighted breast MRI acquisitions acquired with the use of the Dixon method, we train a network on both T1 WOFS and FS acquisitions while utilizing the same ground truth segmentation. Using the ""plug-and-play"" framework nnUNet, we achieve, on our internal test set, a Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 0.96 and 0.91 for WOFS breast and FGT segmentation and 0.95 and 0.86 for FS breast and FGT segmentation, respectively. On an external, publicly available dataset, a panel of breast radiologists rated the quality of our automatic segmentation with an average of 3.73 on a four-point scale, with an average percentage agreement of 67.5%.",The authors would like to kindly thank Linda Appelman for taking part in the reader study conducted for this manuscript.,"This research was funded by EU EFRO OP-Oost Nederland, project name: MARBLE.",Diagnostics,,,2022-07-11,2022,2022-07-11,,12,7,1690,All OA, Gold,Article,"Samperna, Riccardo; Moriakov, Nikita; Karssemeijer, Nico; Teuwen, Jonas; Mann, Ritse M.","Samperna, Riccardo (Department of Medical Imaging, Radboudumc, 6525 GA Nijmegen, The Netherlands;, n.moriakov@nki.nl, (N.M.);, nico.karssemeijer@gmail.com, (N.K.);, j.teuwen@nki.nl, (J.T.);, ritse.mann@radboudumc.nl, (R.M.M.); Department of Radiology, The Netherlands Cancer Institute (NKI), 1066 CX Amsterdam, The Netherlands); Moriakov, Nikita (Department of Medical Imaging, Radboudumc, 6525 GA Nijmegen, The Netherlands;, n.moriakov@nki.nl, (N.M.);, nico.karssemeijer@gmail.com, (N.K.);, j.teuwen@nki.nl, (J.T.);, ritse.mann@radboudumc.nl, (R.M.M.); Department of Radiation Oncology, The Netherlands Cancer Institute (NKI), 1066 CX Amsterdam, The Netherlands); Karssemeijer, Nico (Department of Medical Imaging, Radboudumc, 6525 GA Nijmegen, The Netherlands;, n.moriakov@nki.nl, (N.M.);, nico.karssemeijer@gmail.com, (N.K.);, j.teuwen@nki.nl, (J.T.);, ritse.mann@radboudumc.nl, (R.M.M.); ScreenPoint Medical BV, 6525 EC Nijmegen, The Netherlands); Teuwen, Jonas (Department of Medical Imaging, Radboudumc, 6525 GA Nijmegen, The Netherlands;, n.moriakov@nki.nl, (N.M.);, nico.karssemeijer@gmail.com, (N.K.);, j.teuwen@nki.nl, (J.T.);, ritse.mann@radboudumc.nl, (R.M.M.); Department of Radiation Oncology, The Netherlands Cancer Institute (NKI), 1066 CX Amsterdam, The Netherlands); Mann, Ritse M.

Network models are being studied more and more for medical image segmentation challenges. The encoder-decoder structure is achieving great success, in particular the Unet architecture, which is used as a baseline architecture for the medical image segmentation networks. Traditional Unet and Unet-based networks still have a limitation that is not able to fully exploit the output features of the convolutional units in the node. In this study, we proposed a new network model named TMD-Unet, which had three main enhancements in comparison with Unet: (1) modifying the interconnection of the network node, (2) using dilated convolution instead of the standard convolution, and (3) integrating the multi-scale input features on the input side of the model and applying a dense skip connection instead of a regular skip connection. Our experiments were performed on seven datasets, including many different medical image modalities such as colonoscopy, electron microscopy (EM), dermoscopy, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

Tumor lesions of 111 scans were equally divided between two radiologists and segmented for training. The additional 30 scans were segmented independently by both radiologists for testing. Three 3D U-Net models were trained using either post-contrast images or a combination of post-contrast and subtraction images fused at either the image or the feature level. Segmentation accuracy was evaluated quantitatively using the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and the Hausdorff distance (HD95) and scored qualitatively by a radiologist as excellent, useful, helpful, or unacceptable. Based on this score, a visual ensemble approach selecting the best segmentation among these three models was proposed.ResultsThe mean and standard deviation of DSC and HD95 between the two radiologists were equal to 77.8 ± 10.0% and 5.2 ± 5.9 mm. Using the visual ensemble selection, a DSC and HD95 equal to 78.1 ± 16.2% and 14.1 ± 40.8 mm was reached. The qualitative assessment was excellent (resp. excellent or useful) in 50% (resp. 77%).ConclusionUsing subtraction images in addition to post-contrast images provided complementary information for 3D segmentation of breast lesions by CNN. A visual ensemble selection allowing the radiologist to select the most optimal segmentation obtained by the three 3D U-Net models achieved comparable results to inter-radiologist agreement, yielding 77% segmented volumes considered excellent or useful.Key Points• Deep convolutional neural networks were developed using T1-weighted post-contrast and subtraction MRI to perform automated 3D segmentation of breast tumors.• A visual ensemble selection allowing the radiologist to choose the best segmentation among the three 3D U-Net models outperformed each of the three models.• The visual ensemble selection provided clinically useful segmentations in 77% of cases, potentially allowing for a valuable reduction of the manual 3D segmentation workload for the radiologist and greatly facilitating quantitative studies on non-invasive biomarker in breast MRI.",,"This study has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant agreement No 764458.

Unlabeled data, on the other hand, is much easier to acquire. Semi-supervised learning and unsupervised domain adaptation both take the advantage of unlabeled data, and they are closely related to each other. In this paper, we propose uncertainty-aware multi-view co-training (UMCT), a unified framework that addresses these two tasks for volumetric medical image segmentation. Our framework is capable of efficiently utilizing unlabeled data for better performance. We firstly rotate and permute the 3D volumes into multiple views and train a 3D deep network on each view. We then apply co-training by enforcing multi-view consistency on unlabeled data, where an uncertainty estimation of each view is utilized to achieve accurate labeling. Experiments on the NIH pancreas segmentation dataset and a multi-organ segmentation dataset show state-of-the-art performance of the proposed framework on semi-supervised medical image segmentation. Under unsupervised domain adaptation settings, we validate the effectiveness of this work by adapting our multi-organ segmentation model to two pathological organs from the Medical Segmentation Decathlon Datasets. Additionally, we show that our UMCT-DA model can even effectively handle the challenging situation where labeled source data is inaccessible, demonstrating strong potentials for real-world applications.",,,Medical Image Analysis,,Humans, Supervised Machine Learning, Uncertainty,2020-06-27,2020,2020-06-27,2020-10,65,,101766,All OA, Green,Article,"Xia, Yingda; Yang, Dong; Yu, Zhiding; Liu, Fengze; Cai, Jinzheng; Yu, Lequan; Zhu, Zhuotun; Xu, Daguang; Yuille, Alan; Roth, Holger","Xia, Yingda (Johns Hopkins Unversity, Baltimore, MD, 21218, USA.); Yang, Dong (NVIDIA Corporation, Bethesda, MD, 20814, USA.); Yu, Zhiding (NVIDIA Corporation, Bethesda, MD, 20814, USA.); Liu, Fengze (Johns Hopkins Unversity, Baltimore, MD, 21218, USA.); Cai, Jinzheng (University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, 32611, USA.); Yu, Lequan (The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.); Zhu, Zhuotun (Johns Hopkins Unversity, Baltimore, MD, 21218, USA.); Xu, Daguang (NVIDIA Corporation, Bethesda, MD, 20814, USA.); Yuille, Alan (Johns Hopkins Unversity, Baltimore, MD, 21218, USA.); Roth, Holger (NVIDIA Corporation, Bethesda, MD, 20814, USA.

Nevertheless, manually designing a neural network for a specific segmentation problem is a very difficult and time-consuming task due to the massive hyperparameter search space, long training time and large volumetric data. Therefore, most designed networks are highly complex, task specific and over-parametrized. Recently, multiobjective neural architecture search (NAS) methods have been proposed to automate the design of accurate and efficient segmentation architectures. However, they only search for either the micro- or macro-structure of the architecture, do not use the information produced during the optimization process to increase the efficiency of the search, or do not consider the volumetric nature of medical images. In this work, we present EMONAS-Net, an Efficient MultiObjective NAS framework for 3D medical image segmentation that optimizes both the segmentation accuracy and size of the network. EMONAS-Net has two key components, a novel search space that considers the configuration of the micro- and macro-structure of the architecture and a Surrogate-assisted Multiobjective Evolutionary based Algorithm (SaMEA algorithm) that efficiently searches for the best hyperparameter values. The SaMEA algorithm uses the information collected during the initial generations of the evolutionary process to identify the most promising subproblems and select the best performing hyperparameter values during mutation to improve the convergence speed. Furthermore, a Random Forest surrogate model is incorporated to accelerate the fitness evaluation of the candidate architectures. EMONAS-Net is tested on the tasks of prostate segmentation from the MICCAI PROMISE12 challenge, hippocampus segmentation from the Medical Segmentation Decathlon challenge, and cardiac segmentation from the MICCAI ACDC challenge. In all the benchmarks, the proposed framework finds architectures that perform better or comparable with competing state-of-the-art NAS methods while being considerably smaller and reducing the architecture search time by more than 50%.",,"This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.",Artificial Intelligence in Medicine,,"Algorithms; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Male; Neural Networks, Computer",2021-08-24,2021,2021-08-24,2021-09,119,,102154,Closed,Article,"Baldeon Calisto, Maria; Lai-Yuen, Susana K","Baldeon Calisto, Maria (Departamento de Ingeniería Industrial, Instituto de Innovación en Productividad y Logística CATENA-USFQ, Colegio de Ciencias e Ingeniería, Universidad San Francisco de Quito, Diego de Robles s/n y Vía Interoceánica, Quito 170901, Ecuador.); Lai-Yuen, Susana K (Department of Industrial and Management Systems Engineering, University of South Florida, 4202 E.

However, many traditional computer-aided annotation methods based on anatomical landmarks or the vascular tree often fail to extract accurate liver segments. Furthermore, these methods are difficult to fully automate and thus remain time-consuming. To address these issues, in this study we aim to develop a fully-automated approach for functional region annotation of liver using deep learning based on 2.5D class-aware deep neural networks with spatial adaptation.
METHODS: 112 CT scans were fed into our 2.5D class-aware deep neural network with spatial adaptation for automatic functional region annotation of liver. The proposed model was built upon the ResU-net architecture, which adaptively selected a stack of adjacent CT slices as input and, generating masks corresponding to the center slice, automatically annotated the liver functional region from abdominal CT images. Furthermore, to minimize the problem of class-level ambiguity between different slices, the anatomy class-specific information was used.
RESULTS: The final algorithm performance for automatic functional region annotation of liver showed large overlap with that of manual reference segmentation. The dice similarity coefficient of hepatic segments achieved high scores and an average dice score of 0.882. The entire calculation time was quite fast (~5 s) compared to manual annotation (~2.5 hours).
CONCLUSION: The proposed models described in this paper offer a feasible solution for fully-automated functional region annotation of liver from CT images. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method can attain a high average dice score and low computational time. Therefore, this work should allow for improved liver surgical resection planning by our precise segmentation and simple fully-automated method.",This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 61901463 and 61871374) and Shenzhen Science and Technology Program of China grant JCYJ20170818160306270, Guangdong province key research and development areas grant 2020B1111140001.,,Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine,,"Algorithms; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Liver; Neural Networks, Computer; Tomography, X-Ray Computed",2020-11-04,2020,2020-11-04,2021-03,200,,105818,Closed,Article,"Tian, Yinli; Xue, Fei; Lambo, Ricardo; He, Jiahui; An, Chao; Xie, Yaoqin; Cao, Hailin; Qin, Wenjian","Tian, Yinli (School of Microelectronics and Communication Engineering, Chongqing University, Chongqing 400044, China; Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen 518055, China.); Xue, Fei (Osaka University, 1-1 Yamadaoka, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan.); Lambo, Ricardo (Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen 518055, China.); He, Jiahui (Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen 518055, China.); An, Chao (Department of Minimal invasive intervention, Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou 510060, China.); Xie, Yaoqin (Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen 518055, China.); Cao, Hailin (School of Microelectronics and Communication Engineering, Chongqing University, Chongqing 400044, China.

However, reported inter-rater agreement is modest, and an algorithm that objectively automates grading based on transparent and verifiable criteria could serve as a high-trust diagnostic aid.PurposeTo pilot the development of an automated interpretable multi-stage deep learning-based system to predict AAST grade from admission trauma CT.MethodsOur pipeline includes 4 parts: (1) automated splenic localization, (2) Faster R-CNN-based detection of pseudoaneurysms (PSA) and active bleeds (AB), (3) nnU-Net segmentation and quantification of splenic parenchymal disruption (SPD), and (4) a directed graph that infers AAST grades from detection and segmentation results. Training and validation is performed on a dataset of adult patients (age ≥ 18) with voxelwise labeling, consensus AAST grading, and hemorrhage-related outcome data (n = 174).ResultsAAST classification agreement (weighted κ) between automated and consensus AAST grades was substantial (0.79). High-grade (IV and V) injuries were predicted with accuracy, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 92%, 95%, and 89%. The area under the curve for predicting hemorrhage control intervention was comparable between expert consensus and automated AAST grading (0.83 vs 0.88).

Many recent approaches have also extended U-Net with more complex building blocks, which typically increase the number of network parameters considerably. Such complexity makes the inference stage highly inefficient for clinical applications. Towards an effective yet economic segmentation network design, in this work, we propose backward skip connections that bring decoded features back to the encoder. Our design can be jointly adopted with forward skip connections in any encoder-decoder architecture forming a recurrence structure without introducing extra parameters. With the backward skip connections, we propose a U-Net based network family, namely Bi-directional O-shape networks, which set new benchmarks on multiple public medical imaging segmentation datasets. On the other hand, with the most plain architecture (BiO-Net), network computations inevitably increase along with the pre-set recurrence time. We have thus studied the deficiency bottleneck of such recurrent design and propose a novel two-phase Neural Architecture Search (NAS) algorithm, namely BiX-NAS, to search for the best multi-scale bi-directional skip connections. The ineffective skip connections are then discarded to reduce computational costs and speed up network inference. The finally searched BiX-Net yields the least network complexity and outperforms other state-of-the-art counterparts by large margins. We evaluate our methods on both 2D and 3D segmentation tasks in a total of six datasets.

Almost all existing segmentation networks rely on fully annotated data with strong supervision. However, annotating fully annotated multiorgan data in CT images is both laborious and time-consuming. In comparison, massive partially labeled datasets are usually easily accessible. In this paper, we propose conditional nnU-Net trained on the union of partially labeled datasets for multiorgan segmentation. The deep model employs the state-of-the-art nnU-Net as the backbone and introduces a conditioning strategy by feeding auxiliary information into the decoder architecture as an additional input layer. This model leverages the prior conditional information to identify the organ class at the pixel-wise level and encourages organs' spatial information recovery. Furthermore, we adopt a deep supervision mechanism to refine the outputs at different scales and apply the combination of Dice loss and Focal loss to optimize the training model. Our proposed method is evaluated on seven publicly available datasets of the liver, pancreas, spleen and kidney, in which promising segmentation performance has been achieved. The proposed conditional nnU-Net breaks down the barriers between nonoverlapping labeled datasets and further alleviates the problem of data hunger in multiorgan segmentation.","This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 81871457), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51775368) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51811530310).",,Computers in Biology and Medicine,,,2021-07-21,2021,2021-07-21,2021-09,136,,104658,Closed,Article,"Zhang, Guobin; Yang, Zhiyong; Huo, Bin; Chai, Shude; Jiang, Shan","Zhang, Guobin (School of Mechanical Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin, 300350, China.); Yang, Zhiyong (School of Mechanical Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin, 300350, China.); Huo, Bin (Department of Oncology, Tianjin Medical University Second Hospital, Tianjin, 300211, China.); Chai, Shude (Department of Oncology, Tianjin Medical University Second Hospital, Tianjin, 300211, China.); Jiang, Shan (School of Mechanical Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin, 300350, China.

However, these paired images are difficult to obtain in some cases. Furthermore, the CNNs trained on one specific modality may fail on others for images acquired with different imaging protocols and scanners. Therefore, developing a unified model that can segment the target objects from unpaired multiple modalities is significant for many clinical applications. In this work, we propose a 3D unified generative adversarial network, which unifies the any-to-any modality translation and multimodal segmentation in a single network. Since the anatomical structure is preserved during modality translation, the auxiliary translation task is used to extract the modality-invariant features and generate the additional training data implicitly. To fully utilize the segmentation-related features, we add a cross-task skip connection with feature recalibration from the translation decoder to the segmentation decoder. Experiments on abdominal organ segmentation and brain tumor segmentation indicate that our method outperforms the existing unified methods.","This work is supported by the Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province (2017A030313358, 2017A030313355, 2020A1515010717), the Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province (2016A040403046), the Guangzhou Science and Technology Planning Project (201704030051), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (2019MS073).",,Medical Image Analysis,,"Brain Neoplasms; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Neural Networks, Computer",2020-06-04,2020,2020-06-04,2020-08,64,,101731,Closed,Article,"Yuan, Wenguang; Wei, Jia; Wang, Jiabing; Ma, Qianli; Tasdizen, Tolga","Yuan, Wenguang (School of Computer Science and Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China.); Wei, Jia (School of Computer Science and Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China.

Their limitation stems from them requiring ample data to achieve high performance and adequate generalizability. In the case of clinical imaging data, images are not always available in large quantities. This issue can be alleviated by using data augmentation (DA) techniques. The choice of DA is important because poor selection can possibly hinder the performance of a DL algorithm. We propose a DA policy search algorithm that offers an extended set of transformations that accommodate the variations in biomedical imaging datasets. The algorithm makes use of the efficient and high-dimensional optimizer Bi-Population Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (BIPOP-CMA-ES) and returns an optimal DA policy based on any input imaging dataset and a DL algorithm. Our proposed algorithm, Medical Augmentation (Med-Aug), can be implemented by other researchers in related medical DL applications to improve their model's performance.

The aim of this work was to (1) propose networks to segment breast cancer metastatic lesions on longitudinal whole-body PET/CT and (2) extract imaging biomarkers from the segmentations and evaluate their potential to determine treatment response. Baseline and follow-up PET/CT images of 60 patients from the EPICUREseinmeta study were used to train two deep-learning models to segment breast cancer metastatic lesions: One for baseline images and one for follow-up images. From the automatic segmentations, four imaging biomarkers were computed and evaluated: SULpeak, Total Lesion Glycolysis (TLG), PET Bone Index (PBI) and PET Liver Index (PLI). The first network obtained a mean Dice score of 0.66 on baseline acquisitions. The second network obtained a mean Dice score of 0.58 on follow-up acquisitions. SULpeak, with a 32% decrease between baseline and follow-up, was the biomarker best able to assess patients' response (sensitivity 87%, specificity 87%), followed by TLG (43% decrease, sensitivity 73%, specificity 81%) and PBI (8% decrease, sensitivity 69%, specificity 69%).

However, the performance may be significantly affected by the domain gap between training data (source domain) and testing data (target domain). To address this issue, we propose a data manipulation based domain generalization method, called Automated Augmentation for Domain Generalization (AADG). Our AADG framework can effectively sample data augmentation policies that generate novel domains and diversify the training set from an appropriate search space. Specifically, we introduce a novel proxy task maximizing the diversity among multiple augmented novel domains as measured by the Sinkhorn distance in a unit sphere space, making automated augmentation tractable. Adversarial training and deep reinforcement learning are employed to efficiently search the objectives. Quantitative and qualitative experiments on 11 publicly-accessible fundus image datasets (four for retinal vessel segmentation, four for optic disc and cup (OD/OC) segmentation and three for retinal lesion segmentation) are comprehensively performed. Two OCTA datasets for retinal vasculature segmentation are further involved to validate cross-modality generalization. Our proposed AADG exhibits state-of-the-art generalization performance and outperforms existing approaches by considerable margins on retinal vessel, OD/OC and lesion segmentation tasks. The learned policies are empirically validated to be model-agnostic and can transfer well to other models.

Due to the scarcity of labels in the training phase, semi-supervised methods are widely applied for various medical tasks. To better utilize the unlabeled data, several works have explored the method of uncertainty estimation and exhibited huge success. Despite their impressive performance, we believe that the underlying information of the unlabeled data has been largely unexplored. Meanwhile, there is an extreme foreground-background class imbalance during the training phase of semantic segmentation, which may cause a vast number of easily classified samples to overwhelm the loss during training and lead to a model collapse. In this paper, we proposed uncertainty teacher with dense focal loss, a method that can take good advantage of unlabeled data simultaneously and address the class imbalance problem, based on Deep Co-Training. On one hand, the uncertainty teacher framework is presented to better utilize the unlabeled data by introducing a novel method to regularize uncertainty in the right direction, and the uncertainty is estimated by Monte Carlo Sampling. On the other hand, the dense focal loss is proposed to help solve the class imbalance problem between different classes of samples in medical image segmentation and effectively convert the multi-variate entropy into a multiple binary entropy.

Existing semi-supervised approaches enhance the ability to extract features from unlabeled data with prior knowledge obtained from limited labeled data. However, due to the scarcity of labeled data, the features extracted by the models are limited in supervised learning, and the quality of predictions for unlabeled data also cannot be guaranteed. Both will impede consistency training. To this end, we proposed a novel uncertainty-aware scheme to make models learn regions purposefully. Specifically, we employ Monte Carlo Sampling as an estimation method to attain an uncertainty map, which can serve as a weight for losses to force the models to focus on the valuable region according to the characteristics of supervised learning and unsupervised learning. Simultaneously, in the backward process, we joint unsupervised and supervised losses to accelerate the convergence of the network via enhancing the gradient flow between different tasks.

However, due to the better explainability, feature-based systems are still preferred, especially by physicians. Often, high-dimensional data and low sample size pose different challenges (e.g. increased risk of overfitting) to machine learning systems. By removing irrelevant and redundant features from the data, feature selection is an effective way of pre-processing. The research in this study is focused on unsupervised deep learning-based methods for feature selection. Five recently proposed algorithms are compared regarding their applicability and efficiency on seven data sets in three different sample applications. It was found that deep learning-based feature selection leads to improved classification results compared to conventional methods, especially for small feature subsets. Clinical Relevance - The exploration of distinctive features and the ability to rank their importance without the need for outcome information is a potential field of application for unsupervised feature selection methods.

Acquiring pixel-level annotations is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and relies on extensive expert knowledge. Bounding box annotations, in contrast, are relatively easy to acquire. Thus, in this paper, we explore to segment images through a novel Dual-path Feature Transfer design with only bounding box annotations. Specifically, a Target-aware Reconstructor is proposed to extract target-related features by reconstructing the pixels within the bounding box through the channel and spatial attention module. Then, a sliding Feature Fusion and Transfer Module (FFTM) fuses the extracted features from Reconstructor and transfers them to guide the Segmentor for segmentation. Finally, we present the Confidence Ranking Loss (CRLoss) which dynamically assigns weights to the loss of each pixel based on the network's confidence.

Several tools have been proposed to help deep learning users design their framework for neuroimaging data sets. Software overview: We present here ClinicaDL, one of these software tools. ClinicaDL interacts with BIDS, a standard format in the neuroimaging field, and its derivatives, so it can be used with a large variety of data sets. Moreover, it checks the absence of data leakage when inferring the results of new data with trained networks, and saves all necessary information to guarantee the reproducibility of results. The combination of ClinicaDL and its companion project Clinica allows performing an end-to-end neuroimaging analysis, from the download of raw data sets to the interpretation of trained networks, including neuroimaging preprocessing, quality check, label definition, architecture search, and network training and evaluation.
CONCLUSIONS: We implemented ClinicaDL to bring answers to three common issues encountered by deep learning users who are not always familiar with neuroimaging data: (1) the format and preprocessing of neuroimaging data sets, (2) the contamination of the evaluation procedure by data leakage and (3) a lack of reproducibility. We hope that its use by researchers will allow producing more reliable and thus valuable scientific studies in our field.","The authors would like to thank Junhao Wen for his initial contribution to what became ClinicaDL, Simona Bottani and Omar El Rifai for their contributions and feedback, and Igor Koval for his soothing support.","The research leading to these results has received funding from the French government under management of Agence Nationale de la Recherche as part of the “Investissements d’avenir” program, reference ANR-19-P3IA-0001 (PRAIRIE 3IA Institute) and reference ANR-10-IAIHU-06 (Agence Nationale de la Recherche-10-IA Institut Hospitalo-Universitaire-6).",Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine,,"Deep Learning; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Neuroimaging; Reproducibility of Results; Software",2022-04-19,2022,2022-04-19,2022-06,220,,106818,All OA, Green,Article,"Thibeau-Sutre, Elina; Díaz, Mauricio; Hassanaly, Ravi; Routier, Alexandre; Dormont, Didier; Colliot, Olivier; Burgos, Ninon","Thibeau-Sutre, Elina (Sorbonne Université, Institut du Cerveau - Paris Brain Institute - ICM, CNRS, Inria, Inserm, AP-HP, Hôpital de la Pitié Salpêtrière, Paris, F-75013, France.); Díaz, Mauricio (Sorbonne Université, Institut du Cerveau - Paris Brain Institute - ICM, CNRS, Inria, Inserm, AP-HP, Hôpital de la Pitié Salpêtrière, Paris, F-75013, France.); Hassanaly, Ravi (Sorbonne Université, Institut du Cerveau - Paris Brain Institute - ICM, CNRS, Inria, Inserm, AP-HP, Hôpital de la Pitié Salpêtrière, Paris, F-75013, France.); Routier, Alexandre (Sorbonne Université, Institut du Cerveau - Paris Brain Institute - ICM, CNRS, Inria, Inserm, AP-HP, Hôpital de la Pitié Salpêtrière, Paris, F-75013, France.); Dormont, Didier (Sorbonne Université, Institut du Cerveau - Paris Brain Institute - ICM, CNRS, Inria, Inserm, AP-HP, Hôpital de la Pitié Salpêtrière, DMU DIAMENT, Paris, F-75013, France.); Colliot, Olivier (Sorbonne Université, Institut du Cerveau - Paris Brain Institute - ICM, CNRS, Inria, Inserm, AP-HP, Hôpital de la Pitié Salpêtrière, Paris, F-75013, France.); Burgos, Ninon (Sorbonne Université, Institut du Cerveau - Paris Brain Institute - ICM, CNRS, Inria, Inserm, AP-HP, Hôpital de la Pitié Salpêtrière, Paris, F-75013, France.

Recently, deep learning techniques have dramatically improved performance for image segmentation. However, an important factor preventing deep neural networks from going further is the information loss during the information propagation process. In this article, we present AX-Unet, a deep learning framework incorporating a modified atrous spatial pyramid pooling module to learn the location information and to extract multi-level contextual information to reduce information loss during downsampling. We also introduce a special group convolution operation on the feature map at each level to achieve information decoupling between channels. In addition, we propose an explicit boundary-aware loss function to tackle the blurry boundary problem. We evaluate our model on two public Pancreas-CT datasets, NIH Pancreas-CT dataset, and the pancreas part in medical segmentation decathlon (MSD) medical dataset. The experimental results validate that our model can outperform the state-of-the-art methods in pancreas CT image segmentation. By comparing the extracted feature output of our model, we find that the pancreatic region of normal people and patients with pancreatic tumors shows significant differences.

Models were assessed on 1732 annotated baseline noncontrast CT scans obtained from the Tranexamic Acid for Hyperacute Primary Intracerebral Haemorrhage (ie, TICH-2) international multicenter trial (ISRCTN93732214), and different loss functions using a three-dimensional no-new-U-Net (nnU-Net) were examined to address class imbalance (30% of participants with IVH in dataset). On the test cohort (n = 174, 10% of dataset), the top-performing models achieved median Dice similarity coefficients of 0.92 (IQR, 0.89-0.94), 0.66 (0.58-0.71), and 1.00 (0.87-1.00), respectively, for ICH, PHE, and IVH segmentation. U-Net-based networks showed comparable, satisfactory performances on ICH and PHE segmentations (P > .05), but all nnU-Net variants achieved higher accuracy than the Brain Lesion Analysis and Segmentation Tool for CT (BLAST-CT) and DeepLabv3+ for all labels (P < .05). The Focal model showed improved performance in IVH segmentation compared with the Tversky, two-dimensional nnU-Net, U-Net, BLAST-CT, and DeepLabv3+ models (P < .05). Focal achieved concordance values of 0.98, 0.88, and 0.99 for ICH, PHE, and ICH volumes, respectively. The mean volumetric differences between the ground truth and prediction were 0.32 mL (95% CI: -8.35, 9.00), 1.14 mL (-9.53, 11.8), and 0.06 mL (-1.71, 1.84), respectively.

We develop a cubic volume-measure-preserving OMT (V-OMT) model for the implementation of this conversion. The contrast-enhanced histogram equalization grayscale of fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) in a brain image creates the corresponding density function. We then propose an effective two-phase residual U-net algorithm combined with the V-OMT algorithm for training and validation. First, we use the residual U-net and V-OMT algorithms to precisely predict the whole tumor (WT) region. Second, we expand this predicted WT region with dilation and create a smooth function by convolving the step-like function associated with the WT region in the brain image with a 5×5×5\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

While semantic segmentation algorithms enable image analysis and quantification in many applications, the design of respective specialized solutions is non-trivial and highly dependent on dataset properties and hardware conditions. We developed nnU-Net, a deep learning-based segmentation method that automatically configures itself, including preprocessing, network architecture, training and post-processing for any new task. The key design choices in this process are modeled as a set of fixed parameters, interdependent rules and empirical decisions. Without manual intervention, nnU-Net surpasses most existing approaches, including highly specialized solutions on 23 public datasets used in international biomedical segmentation competitions. We make nnU-Net publicly available as an out-of-the-box tool, rendering state-of-the-art segmentation accessible to a broad audience by requiring neither expert knowledge nor computing resources beyond standard network training.","This work was co-funded by the National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT) in Heidelberg and the Helmholtz Imaging Platform (HIP).

3546,pub.1149468651,10.1002/mp.15827,35833617,,Multiscale unsupervised domain adaptation for automatic pancreas segmentation in CT volumes using adversarial learning,"PURPOSE: Computer-aided automatic pancreas segmentation is essential for early diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic diseases. However, the annotation of pancreas images requires professional doctors and considerable expenditure. Due to imaging differences among various institution population, scanning devices, imaging protocols, and so on, significant degradation in the performance of model inference results is prone to occur when models trained with domain-specific (usually institution-specific) datasets are directly applied to new (other centers/institutions) domain data. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised domain adaptation method based on adversarial learning to address pancreas segmentation challenges with the lack of annotations and domain shift interference.
METHODS: A 3D semantic segmentation model with attention module and residual module is designed as the backbone pancreas segmentation model. In both segmentation model and domain adaptation discriminator network, a multiscale progressively weighted structure is introduced to acquire different field of views. Features of labeled data and unlabeled data are fed in pairs into the proposed multiscale discriminator to learn domain-specific characteristics. Then the unlabeled data features with pseudodomain label are fed to the discriminator to acquire domain-ambiguous information. With this adversarial learning strategy, the performance of the segmentation network is enhanced to segment unseen unlabeled data.
RESULTS: Experiments were conducted on two public annotated datasets as source datasets, respectively, and one private dataset as target dataset, where annotations were not used for the training process but only for evaluation. The 3D segmentation model achieves comparative performance with state-of-the-art pancreas segmentation methods on source domain. After implementing our domain adaptation architecture, the average dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of the segmentation model trained on the NIH-TCIA source dataset increases from 58.79% to 72.73% on the local hospital dataset, while the performance of the target domain segmentation model transferred from the medical segmentation decathlon (MSD) source dataset rises from 62.34% to 71.17%.
CONCLUSIONS: Correlations of features across data domains are utilized to train the pancreas segmentation model on unlabeled data domain, improving the generalization of the model. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method enables the segmentation model to make meaningful segmentation for unseen data of the training set. In the future, the proposed method has the potential to apply segmentation model trained on public dataset to clinical unannotated CT images from local hospital, effectively assisting radiologists in clinical practice.","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 12101571, No. 82172069, No. 81702332), the Key Research Project of Zhejiang Laboratory (No. 2022ND0AC01), the Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China (No. LQ20H180001), the Zhejiang Provincial Key Research and Development Program (No. 2020C03117), and the Selected Project Funded by Zhejiang Province Postdoctoral Research Projects (No. 2020ND2UA01).",,Medical Physics,,"Deep Learning; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Pancreas; Tomography, X-Ray Computed",2022-07-27,2022,2022-07-27,2022-09,49,9,5799-5818,Closed,Article,"Zhu, Yan; Hu, Peijun; Li, Xiang; Tian, Yu; Bai, Xueli; Liang, Tingbo; Li, Jingsong","Zhu, Yan (Engineering Research Center of EMR and Intelligent Expert System, Ministry of Education, College of Biomedical Engineering and Instrument Science, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China); Hu, Peijun (Research Center for Healthcare Data Science, Zhejiang Lab, Hangzhou, China); Li, Xiang (Department of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery, the First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China; Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Pancreatic Disease, Hangzhou, China); Tian, Yu (Engineering Research Center of EMR and Intelligent Expert System, Ministry of Education, College of Biomedical Engineering and Instrument Science, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China); Bai, Xueli (Department of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery, the First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China; Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Pancreatic Disease, Hangzhou, China); Liang, Tingbo (Department of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery, the First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China; Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Pancreatic Disease, Hangzhou, China); Li, Jingsong (Engineering Research Center of EMR and Intelligent Expert System, Ministry of Education, College of Biomedical Engineering and Instrument Science, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China; Research Center for Healthcare Data Science, Zhejiang Lab, Hangzhou, China)","Li, Jingsong (Zhejiang University; Zhejiang Lab)","Zhu, Yan (Zhejiang University); Hu, Peijun (Zhejiang Lab); Li, Xiang (Zhejiang University; First Affiliated Hospital Zhejiang University); Tian, Yu (Zhejiang University); Bai, Xueli (Zhejiang University; First Affiliated Hospital Zhejiang University); Liang, Tingbo (Zhejiang University; First Affiliated Hospital Zhejiang University); Li, Jingsong (Zhejiang University; Zhejiang Lab)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1149468651,40 Engineering, 4003 Biomedical Engineering, 51 Physical Sciences, 5105 Medical and Biological Physics,,,,,,,,,

In medical applications however, the sensitive nature of the data limits the collection and exchange of large-scale datasets. Privacy-preserving and collaborative learning systems can enable the successful application of machine learning in medicine. However, collaborative protocols such as federated learning require the frequent transfer of parameter updates over a network. To enable the deployment of such protocols to a wide range of systems with varying computational performance, efficient deep learning architectures for resource-constrained environments are required. Here we present MoNet, a small, highly optimized neural-network-based segmentation algorithm leveraging efficient multi-scale image features. MoNet is a shallow, U-Net-like architecture based on repeated, dilated convolutions with decreasing dilation rates. We apply and test our architecture on the challenging clinical tasks of pancreatic segmentation in computed tomography (CT) images as well as brain tumor segmentation in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. We assess our model's segmentation performance and demonstrate that it provides performance on par with compared architectures while providing superior out-of-sample generalization performance, outperforming larger architectures on an independent validation set, while utilizing significantly fewer parameters. We furthermore confirm the suitability of our architecture for federated learning applications by demonstrating a substantial reduction in serialized model storage requirement as a surrogate for network data transfer. Finally, we evaluate MoNet's inference latency on the central processing unit (CPU) to determine its utility in environments without access to graphics processing units. Our implementation is publicly available as free and open-source software.","Rickmer Braren received funding from: German Research Foundation, Priority Programme SPP2177 Radiomics: Next Generation of Biomedical Imaging German Cancer Consortium Joint Funding UPGRADE Programme: Subtyping of Pancreatic Cancer based on radiographic and pathological Features Bavarian Research Foundation Deutsches Konsortium für Translationale Krebsforschung, SUBPAN Georgios Kaissis received funding from: The Technical University of Munich Clinician Scientist Programme, Grant Reference H-14.

The majority of cases of this condition may be traced back to pancreatic cancer. Due to medical image scans, a significant number of cancer patients are able to identify abnormalities at an earlier stage. The expensive cost of the necessary gear and infrastructure makes it difficult to disseminate the technology, putting it out of the reach of a lot of people. This article presents detection of pancreatic cancer in CT scan images using machine PSO SVM and image processing. The Gaussian elimination filter is utilized during the image preprocessing stage of the removal of noise from images. The K means algorithm uses a partitioning technique to separate the image into its component parts. The process of identifying objects in an image and determining the regions of interest is aided by image segmentation. The PCA method is used to extract important information from digital photographs. PSO SVM, naive Bayes, and AdaBoost are the algorithms that are used to perform the classification. Accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the PSO SVM algorithm are better.",,,BioMed Research International,,"Algorithms; Bayes Theorem; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Pancreatic Neoplasms; Support Vector Machine; Tomography, X-Ray Computed",2022-07-26,2022,2022-07-26,2022-07-26,2022,,8544337,All OA, Gold,Article,"Ansari, Arshiya S; Zamani, Abu Sarwar; Mohammadi, Mohammad Sajid; Meenakshi; Ritonga, Mahyudin; Ahmed, Syed Sohail; Pounraj, Devabalan; Kaliyaperumal, Karthikeyan","Ansari, Arshiya S (Department of Information Technology, College of Computer and Information Sciences, Majmaah University, Al-Majmaah 11952, Saudi Arabia.); Zamani, Abu Sarwar (Department of Computer and Self Development, Preparatory Year Deanship, Prince Sattam Bin Abdulaziz University, Al-Kharj, Saudi Arabia.); Mohammadi, Mohammad Sajid (Department of Information Technology, College of Computer, Qassim University, Buraydah, Saudi Arabia.); Meenakshi (GD Goenka University Sohna Haryana, India.); Ritonga, Mahyudin (Universitas Muhammadiyah Sumatera Barat, Indonesia.); Ahmed, Syed Sohail (Department of Computer Engineering, Qassim University, Buraydah, Saudi Arabia.); Pounraj, Devabalan (BVC Engineering College (Autonomous), Odalarevu, Allavaram Mandal, East-GodhavariDistrict, Andhra Pradesh, India.); Kaliyaperumal, Karthikeyan (IT @ IoT-HH Campus, Ambo University, Ethiopia.)","Kaliyaperumal, Karthikeyan (Ambo University)","Ansari, Arshiya S (Majmaah University); Zamani, Abu Sarwar (Prince Sattam Bin Abdulaziz University); Mohammadi, Mohammad Sajid (Qassim University); Meenakshi (GD Goenka University); Ritonga, Mahyudin (Universitas Muhammadiyah Sumatera Barat); Ahmed, Syed Sohail (Qassim University); Pounraj, Devabalan (); Kaliyaperumal, Karthikeyan (Ambo University)",1,1,,,https://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2022/8544337.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1149770442,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences, 3211 Oncology and Carcinogenesis, 46 Information and Computing Sciences,,,,,,,,,

However, only a few studies have comprehensively compared medical image registration approaches on a wide range of clinically relevant tasks. This limits the development of registration methods, the adoption of research advances into practice, and a fair benchmark across competing approaches. The Learn2Reg challenge addresses these limitations by providing a multi-task medical image registration data set for comprehensive characterisation of deformable registration algorithms. A continuous evaluation will be possible at https:// learn2reg.grand-challenge.org. Learn2Reg covers a wide range of anatomies (brain, abdomen, and thorax), modalities (ultrasound, CT, MR), availability of annotations, as well as intra- and inter-patient registration evaluation. We established an easily accessible framework for training and validation of 3D registration methods, which enabled the compilation of results of over 65 individual method submissions from more than 20 unique teams. We used a complementary set of metrics, including robustness, accuracy, plausibility, and runtime, enabling unique insight into the current state-of-the-art of medical image registration. This paper describes datasets, tasks, evaluation methods and results of the challenge, as well as results of further analysis of transferability to new datasets, the importance of label supervision, and resulting bias. While no single approach worked best across all tasks, many methodological aspects could be identified that push the performance of medical image registration to new state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, we demystified the common belief that conventional registration methods have to be much slower than deep-learning-based methods.",,,IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging,,,2022-10-20,2022,2022-10-20,2022-10-20,PP,99,1-1,All OA, Hybrid,Article,"Hering, Alessa; Hansen, Lasse; Mok, Tony C.

However, acquiring and manually labeling a large medical image set is resource-intensive, expensive, and sometimes impractical due to data sharing and privacy issues. To address this challenge, we propose AdvChain, a generic adversarial data augmentation framework, aiming at improving both the diversity and effectiveness of training data for medical image segmentation tasks. AdvChain augments data with dynamic data augmentation, generating randomly chained photo-metric and geometric transformations to resemble realistic yet challenging imaging variations to expand training data. By jointly optimizing the data augmentation model and a segmentation network during training, challenging examples are generated to enhance network generalizability for the downstream task. The proposed adversarial data augmentation does not rely on generative networks and can be used as a plug-in module in general segmentation networks. It is computationally efficient and applicable for both low-shot supervised and semi-supervised learning. We analyze and evaluate the method on two MR image segmentation tasks: cardiac segmentation and prostate segmentation with limited labeled data. Results show that the proposed approach can alleviate the need for labeled data while improving model generalization ability, indicating its practical value in medical imaging applications.","This work was supported by two EPSRC Grants (EP/P001009/1, EP/R005982/1) and the ERC Grant (884622).

Although various two-dimensional (2D) and 3D neural network models have been applied to 3D medical image segmentation and achieved impressive results, a trade-off remains between efficiency and accuracy. To address this issue, a novel mixture convolutional network (MixConvNet) is proposed, in which traditional 2D/3D convolutional blocks are replaced with novel MixConv blocks. In the MixConv block, 3D convolution is decomposed into a mixture of 2D convolutions from different views. Therefore, the MixConv block fully utilizes the advantages of 2D convolution and maintains the learning ability of 3D convolution. It acts as 3D convolutions and thus can process volumetric input directly and learn intra-slice features, which are absent in the traditional 2D convolutional block. By contrast, the proposed MixConv block only contains 2D convolutions; hence, it has significantly fewer trainable parameters and less computation budget than a block containing 3D convolutions. Furthermore, the proposed MixConvNet is pre-trained with small input patches and fine-tuned with large input patches to improve segmentation performance further. In experiments on the Decathlon Heart dataset and Sliver07 dataset, the proposed MixConvNet outperformed the state-of-the-art methods such as UNet3D, VNet, and nnUnet.",,,International Journal of Neural Systems,,"Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Neural Networks, Computer; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted",2022-11-04,2022,2022-11-04,2023-01,33,1,2250059,Closed,Article,"Wang, Jianyong; Zhang, Lei; Zhang, Yi","Wang, Jianyong (Machine Intelligence Laboratory, College of Computer Science, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, P.

Existing detection methods largely rely on two-stage detectors and use CT images marked with bounding boxes for training and detection. In this study, we propose a single-stage detector method designed to accurately detect multiple tumors simultaneously, and provide results demonstrating its increased speed and efficiency compared to prior methods. The proposed model divides CT images into multiple channels to obtain continuity information and implements a bounding box attention mechanism to overcome the limitation of inaccurate prediction of tumor center points and decrease redundant bounding boxes. The model integrates information from various channels using an effective Squeeze-and-Excitation attention module. The proposed model obtained a mean average precision result of 0.476 on the Decathlon dataset, which was superior to that of the prior methods examined for comparison. This research is expected to enable physicians to diagnose tumors very efficiently; particularly, the prediction of tumor center points is expected to enable physicians to rapidly verify their diagnostic judgments. The proposed method is considered suitable for future adoption in clinical practice in hospitals and resource-poor areas because its superior performance does not increase computational cost; hence, the equipment required is relatively inexpensive.",,,Physics in Medicine and Biology,,"Abdomen; Humans; Liver Neoplasms; Radiopharmaceuticals; Tomography, X-Ray Computed",2021-11-29,2021,2021-11-29,2021-12-07,66,23,235009,Closed,Article,"Peng, Xuefeng; Yang, Xinwu","Peng, Xuefeng (The Faculty of Information, Beijing, University of Technology, Beijing, People’s Republic of China); Yang, Xinwu (The Faculty of Information, Beijing, University of Technology, Beijing, People’s Republic of China)","Yang, Xinwu (Beijing University of Technology)","Peng, Xuefeng (Beijing University of Technology); Yang, Xinwu (Beijing University of Technology)",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1142363642,51 Physical Sciences, 5105 Medical and Biological Physics,,,,,,,,,,,

Diagnosis is complicated by the heterogeneity of radiographic features in both normal (e.g. complex anatomy, pregnancy) and pathologic states (e.g. primary endocrinopathy, hypophysitis). Clinical symptoms and laboratory testing are often equivocal, which can result in misdiagnosis or unnecessary specialist referrals. Computer vision models can aid in pituitary adenoma diagnosis; however, a major challenge to model development is the lack of dedicated pituitary imaging datasets. We hypothesized that deep volumetric segmentation models trained to extract the sellar and parasellar region from existing whole-brain MRI scans could be used to generate a novel dataset of pituitary imaging.MethodsSix open-source whole-brain MRI datasets, created for research purposes, were included for model development. Deep learning-based volumetric segmentation models were trained using 318 manually annotated MRI scans from a single open-source MRI dataset. Out-of-distribution volumetric segmentation performance was then tested on 418 MRIs from five held-out research datasets.ResultsOn our annotated images, agreement between manual and model volumetric segmentations was high. Dice scores (a measure of overlap) ranged 0.76–0.82 for both in-distribution and out-of-distribution model testing. In total, 6,755 MRIs from six data sources were included in the final generated pituitary dataset.ConclusionsWe present the first and largest dataset of pituitary imaging constructed using existing MRI data and deep volumetric segmentation models trained to identify sellar and parasellar anatomy. The model generalizes well across patient populations and MRI scanner types.

3189,pub.1136534521,10.1002/mp.14852,33742454,,Interactive contouring through contextual deep learning,"PURPOSE: To investigate a deep learning approach that enables three-dimensional (3D) segmentation of an arbitrary structure of interest given a user provided two-dimensional (2D) contour for context. Such an approach could decrease delineation times and improve contouring consistency, particularly for anatomical structures for which no automatic segmentation tools exist.
METHODS: A series of deep learning segmentation models using a Recurrent Residual U-Net with attention gates was trained with a successively expanding training set. Contextual information was provided to the models, using a previously contoured slice as an input, in addition to the slice to be contoured. In total, 6 models were developed, and 19 different anatomical structures were used for training and testing. Each of the models was evaluated for all 19 structures, even if they were excluded from the training set, in order to assess the model's ability to segment unseen structures of interest. Each model's performance was evaluated using the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), Hausdorff distance, and relative added path length (APL).
RESULTS: The segmentation performance for seen and unseen structures improved when the training set was expanded by addition of structures previously excluded from the training set. A model trained exclusively on heart structures achieved a DSC of 0.33, HD of 44 mm, and relative APL of 0.85 when segmenting the spleen, whereas a model trained on a diverse set of structures, but still excluding the spleen, achieved a DSC of 0.80, HD of 13 mm, and relative APL of 0.35. Iterative prediction performed better compared to direct prediction when considering unseen structures.
CONCLUSIONS: Training a contextual deep learning model on a diverse set of structures increases the segmentation performance for the structures in the training set, but importantly enables the model to generalize and make predictions even for unseen structures that were not represented in the training set. This shows that user-provided context can be incorporated into deep learning contouring to facilitate semi-automatic segmentation of CT images for any given structure. Such an approach can enable faster de-novo contouring in clinical practice.",This project has received funding from the European Union&#x27,s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Skłodowska‐Curie grant agreement No. 766276.

3182,pub.1147249273,10.1002/mp.15679,35443086,,Multi‐eXpert fusion: An ensemble learning framework to segment 3D TRUS prostate images,"PURPOSE: Prostate segmentation of 3D TRUS images is a prerequisite for several diagnostic and therapeutic applications. Unfortunately, this difficult task suffers from high intra and interobserver variability, even for experienced urologists/radiologists. This is why automatic segmentation algorithms could have a significant clinical added-value.
METHODS: This paper introduces a new deep segmentation architecture consisting of two main phases: view-specific segmentations of 2D slices and their fusion. The segmentation phase is based on three segmentation networks trained in parallel on specific slice viewing directions: axial, coronal, and sagittal. The proposed fusion network is then fed with the output of the segmentation networks and trained to produce three confidence maps. These maps correspond to the local trust granted by the fusion network to each view-specific segmentation network. Finally, for a given slice, the segmentation is computed by combining these confidence maps with their corresponding segmentations. The 3D segmentation of the prostate is obtained by restacking all the segmented slices to form a volume.
RESULTS: This approach was evaluated on a database of 100 patients with several combinations of network architectures (for both the segmentation phase and the fusion phase) to show the flexibility and reliability of the framework. The proposed approach was also compared to STAPLE, to the majority voting strategy, and to a direct 3D approach tested on the same database. The new method outperforms these three approaches on all evaluation criteria. Finally, the results of the multi-eXpert fusion (MXF) framework compare favorably with other state-of-the-art methods, while these methods typically work on smaller databases.
CONCLUSIONS: We proposed a novel MXF framework to segment 3D TRUS images of the prostate. The main feature of this approach is the fusion of expert network results at the pixel level using computed confidence maps. Experiments conducted on a clinical database have shown the robustness and flexibility of this approach and its superiority over state-of-the-art approaches. Finally, the MXF framework demonstrated its ability to capture and preserve the underlying gland structures, particularly in the base and apex regions.",The authors want to thank the urologists from Grenoble University Hospital for providing the data.,,Medical Physics,,"Algorithms; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Machine Learning; Male; Prostate; Reproducibility of Results",2022-04-29,2022,2022-04-29,2022-08,49,8,5138-5148,All OA, Green,Article,"Beitone, Clément; Troccaz, Jocelyne","Beitone, Clément (Univ.

Advances in artificial intelligence, especially deep learning (DL), allow development of automatic segmentation that overcome the labor-intensive and operator-dependent manual segmentation. We aimed to evaluate the accuracy of the top-performing DL model from the 2018 Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) challenge, the impact of missing MRI sequences, and whether a model trained on gliomas can accurately segment other brain tumor types.MethodsWe trained the model using Medical Decathlon dataset, applied it to the BraTS 2019 glioma dataset, and developed additional models using individual and multimodal MRI sequences. The Dice score was calculated to assess the model’s accuracy compared to ground truth labels by neuroradiologists on BraTS dataset. The model was then applied to a local dataset of 105 brain tumors, performance of which was qualitatively evaluated.ResultsThe DL model using pre- and post-gadolinium contrast T1 and T2 FLAIR sequences performed best, with a Dice score 0.878 for whole tumor, 0.732 tumor core, and 0.699 active tumor. Lack of T1 or T2 sequences did not significantly degrade performance, but FLAIR and T1C were important contributors. All segmentations performed by the model in the local dataset, including non-glioma cases, were considered accurate by a pool of specialists.ConclusionThe DL model could use available MRI sequences to optimize glioma segmentation and adopt transfer learning to segment non-glioma tumors, thereby serving as a useful tool to improve treatment planning and personalized surveillance of patients.","Special thanks to the Macquarie Neurosurgery members, above all Prof. Marcus Stoodley, as well as to Prof. Roger Chung, Associate Dean, Faculty of Medicine, Human and Health Sciences, and Prof. Enrico Coiera, Director of the Centre for Health Informatics and Australian Institute of Health Innovation, Macquarie University, for their uninterrupted support.",,Neuroradiology,,"Artificial Intelligence; Brain Neoplasms; Deep Learning; Heuristics; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy",2021-01-26,2021,2021-01-26,2021-08,63,8,1253-1262,Closed,Article,"Di Ieva, Antonio; Russo, Carlo; Liu, Sidong; Jian, Anne; Bai, Michael Y.; Qian, Yi; Magnussen, John S.","Di Ieva, Antonio (Department of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Human and Health Sciences, Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia; Computational NeuroSurgery (CNS) Lab, Department of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Human and Health Sciences, Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia; Macquarie Neurosurgery, Macquarie University, Level 2, Suite 201, 2 Technology Place, 2109, Sydney, NSW, Australia); Russo, Carlo (Computational NeuroSurgery (CNS) Lab, Department of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Human and Health Sciences, Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia); Liu, Sidong (Computational NeuroSurgery (CNS) Lab, Department of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Human and Health Sciences, Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia; Australian Institute of Health Innovation, Centre for Health Informatics, Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia); Jian, Anne (Computational NeuroSurgery (CNS) Lab, Department of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Human and Health Sciences, Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia; Melbourne Medical School, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia); Bai, Michael Y.

Materials and Methods Retrospectively collected contrast-enhanced CT studies in patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer between January 2006 and July 2018 were compared with CT studies of individuals with a normal pancreas (control group) obtained between January 2004 and December 2019. An end-to-end tool comprising a segmentation convolutional neural network (CNN) and a classifier ensembling five CNNs was developed and validated in the internal test set and a nationwide real-world validation set. The sensitivities of the computer-aided detection (CAD) tool and radiologist interpretation were compared using the McNemar test. Results A total of 546 patients with pancreatic cancer (mean age, 65 years ± 12 [SD], 297 men) and 733 control subjects were randomly divided into training, validation, and test sets. In the internal test set, the DL tool achieved 89.9% (98 of 109; 95% CI: 82.7, 94.9) sensitivity and 95.9% (141 of 147; 95% CI: 91.3, 98.5) specificity (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC], 0.96; 95% CI: 0.94, 0.99), without a significant difference (P = .11) in sensitivity compared with the original radiologist report (96.1% [98 of 102]; 95% CI: 90.3, 98.9). In a test set of 1473 real-world CT studies (669 malignant, 804 control) from institutions throughout Taiwan, the DL tool distinguished between CT malignant and control studies with 89.7% (600 of 669; 95% CI: 87.1, 91.9) sensitivity and 92.8% specificity (746 of 804; 95% CI: 90.8, 94.5) (AUC, 0.95; 95% CI: 0.94, 0.96), with 74.7% (68 of 91; 95% CI: 64.5, 83.3) sensitivity for malignancies smaller than 2 cm. Conclusion The deep learning-based tool enabled accurate detection of pancreatic cancer on CT scans, with reasonable sensitivity for tumors smaller than 2 cm. © RSNA, 2022 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

The most commonly used U-Net and its variants often share two common characteristics but lack solid evidence for the effectiveness. First, each block (i.e., consecutive convolutions of feature maps of the same resolution) outputs feature maps from the last convolution, limiting the variety of the receptive fields. Second, the network has a symmetric structure where the encoder and the decoder paths have similar numbers of channels. We explored two novel revisions: a stacked dilated operation that outputs feature maps from multi-scale receptive fields to replace the consecutive convolutions; an asymmetric architecture with fewer channels in the decoder path. Two novel models were developed: U-Net using the stacked dilated operation (SDU-Net) and asymmetric SDU-Net (ASDU-Net). We used both publicly available and private datasets to assess the efficacy of the proposed models. Extensive experiments confirmed SDU-Net outperformed or achieved performance similar to the state-of-the-art while using fewer parameters (40% of U-Net). ASDU-Net further reduced the model parameters to 20% of U-Net with performance comparable to SDU-Net. In conclusion, the stacked dilated operation and the asymmetric structure are promising for improving the performance of U-Net and its variants.","Dr. Samir’s effort on this work was supported by the NIDDK of the National Institutes of Health, United States under award number R01DK119860.

Artificial intelligence (AI) support systems can improve the diagnostic accuracy of radiologists, as shown for a variety of imaging tasks. Improvements in diagnostic performance, in particular the reduction of false-negative findings, may be useful in patient care.
Objective: To develop and evaluate a deep learning algorithm able to differentiate colon carcinoma (CC) and acute diverticulitis (AD) on CT images and analyze the impact of the AI-support system in a reader study.
Design, Setting, and Participants: In this diagnostic study, patients who underwent surgery between July 1, 2005, and October 1, 2020, for CC or AD were included. Three-dimensional (3-D) bounding boxes including the diseased bowel segment and surrounding mesentery were manually delineated and used to develop a 3-D convolutional neural network (CNN). A reader study with 10 observers of different experience levels was conducted. Readers were asked to classify the testing cohort under reading room conditions, first without and then with algorithmic support.
Main Outcomes and Measures: To evaluate the diagnostic performance, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated for all readers and reader groups with and without AI support. Metrics were compared using the McNemar test and relative and absolute predictive value comparisons.
Results: A total of 585 patients (AD: n = 267, CC: n = 318; mean [SD] age, 63.2 [13.4] years; 341 men [58.3%]) were included. The 3-D CNN reached a sensitivity of 83.3% (95% CI, 70.0%-96.6%) and specificity of 86.6% (95% CI, 74.5%-98.8%) for the test set, compared with the mean reader sensitivity of 77.6% (95% CI, 72.9%-82.3%) and specificity of 81.6% (95% CI, 77.2%-86.1%). The combined group of readers improved significantly with AI support from a sensitivity of 77.6% to 85.6% (95% CI, 81.3%-89.3%; P < .001) and a specificity of 81.6% to 91.3% (95% CI, 88.1%-94.5%; P < .001). Artificial intelligence support significantly reduced the number of false-negative and false-positive findings (NPV from 78.5% to 86.4% and PPV from 80.9% to 90.8%; P < .001).
Conclusions and Relevance: The findings of this study suggest that a deep learning model able to distinguish CC and AD in CT images as a support system may significantly improve the diagnostic performance of radiologists, which may improve patient care.",,,JAMA Network Open,,"Male; Humans; Middle Aged; Artificial Intelligence; Deep Learning; Retrospective Studies; Algorithms; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Diverticulitis; Carcinoma; Colon",2023-01-03,2023,2023-01-27,2023-01-03,6,1,e2253370,All OA, Gold,Article,"Ziegelmayer, Sebastian; Reischl, Stefan; Havrda, Hannah; Gawlitza, Joshua; Graf, Markus; Lenhart, Nicolas; Nehls, Nadja; Lemke, Tristan; Wilhelm, Dirk; Lohöfer, Fabian; Burian, Egon; Neumann, Philipp-Alexander; Makowski, Marcus; Braren, Rickmer","Ziegelmayer, Sebastian (Institute of Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology, Technical University of Munich, School of Medicine, Munich, Germany); Reischl, Stefan (Institute of Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology, Technical University of Munich, School of Medicine, Munich, Germany); Havrda, Hannah (Institute of Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology, Technical University of Munich, School of Medicine, Munich, Germany); Gawlitza, Joshua (Institute of Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology, Technical University of Munich, School of Medicine, Munich, Germany); Graf, Markus (Institute of Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology, Technical University of Munich, School of Medicine, Munich, Germany); Lenhart, Nicolas (Institute of Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology, Technical University of Munich, School of Medicine, Munich, Germany); Nehls, Nadja (Institute of Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology, Technical University of Munich, School of Medicine, Munich, Germany); Lemke, Tristan (Institute of Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology, Technical University of Munich, School of Medicine, Munich, Germany); Wilhelm, Dirk (Department of Surgery, Technical University of Munich, School of Medicine, Munich, Germany); Lohöfer, Fabian (Institute of Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology, Technical University of Munich, School of Medicine, Munich, Germany); Burian, Egon (Institute of Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology, Technical University of Munich, School of Medicine, Munich, Germany); Neumann, Philipp-Alexander (Department of Surgery, Technical University of Munich, School of Medicine, Munich, Germany); Makowski, Marcus (Institute of Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology, Technical University of Munich, School of Medicine, Munich, Germany); Braren, Rickmer (Institute of Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology, Technical University of Munich, School of Medicine, Munich, Germany)","Ziegelmayer, Sebastian (Technical University of Munich)","Ziegelmayer, Sebastian (Technical University of Munich); Reischl, Stefan (Technical University of Munich); Havrda, Hannah (Technical University of Munich); Gawlitza, Joshua (Technical University of Munich); Graf, Markus (Technical University of Munich); Lenhart, Nicolas (Technical University of Munich); Nehls, Nadja (Technical University of Munich); Lemke, Tristan (Technical University of Munich); Wilhelm, Dirk (Technical University of Munich); Lohöfer, Fabian (Technical University of Munich); Burian, Egon (Technical University of Munich); Neumann, Philipp-Alexander (Technical University of Munich); Makowski, Marcus (Technical University of Munich); Braren, Rickmer (Technical University of Munich)",0,0,,,https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/articlepdf/2800855/ziegelmayer_2023_oi_221509_1674184348.86751.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1154909695,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences, 3202 Clinical Sciences,,,,,,,,,,

Deep learning can facilitate PDAC diagnosis; however, current models still fail to identify small (<2 cm) lesions. In this study, state-of-the-art deep learning models were used to develop an automatic framework for PDAC detection, focusing on small lesions. Additionally, the impact of integrating the surrounding anatomy was investigated. CE-CT scans from a cohort of 119 pathology-proven PDAC patients and a cohort of 123 patients without PDAC were used to train a nnUnet for automatic lesion detection and segmentation (nnUnet_T). Two additional nnUnets were trained to investigate the impact of anatomy integration: (1) segmenting the pancreas and tumor (nnUnet_TP), and (2) segmenting the pancreas, tumor, and multiple surrounding anatomical structures (nnUnet_MS). An external, publicly available test set was used to compare the performance of the three networks. The nnUnet_MS achieved the best performance, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.91 for the whole test set and 0.88 for tumors <2 cm, showing that state-of-the-art deep learning can detect small PDAC and benefits from anatomy information.",,,Cancers,,,2022-01-13,2022,2022-01-13,,14,2,376,All OA, Gold,Article,"Alves, Natália; Schuurmans, Megan; Litjens, Geke; Bosma, Joeran S.; Hermans, John; Huisman, Henkjan","Alves, Natália (Diagnostic Image Analysis Group, Department of Medical Imaging, Radboud University Medical Center, 6500 HB Nijmegen, The Netherlands;, megan.schuurmans@radboudumc.nl, (M.S.);, joeran.bosma@radboudumc.nl, (J.S.B.);, henkjan.huisman@radboudumc.nl, (H.H.)); Schuurmans, Megan (Diagnostic Image Analysis Group, Department of Medical Imaging, Radboud University Medical Center, 6500 HB Nijmegen, The Netherlands;, megan.schuurmans@radboudumc.nl, (M.S.);, joeran.bosma@radboudumc.nl, (J.S.B.);, henkjan.huisman@radboudumc.nl, (H.H.)); Litjens, Geke (Department of Medical Imaging, Radboud Institute for Health Sciences, 6500 HB Nijmegen, The Netherlands;, g.litjens@radboudumc.nl, (G.L.);, John.Hermans@radboudumc.nl, (J.H.)); Bosma, Joeran S.

While numerous methods for detecting, segmenting and tracking of medical instruments based on endoscopic video images have been proposed in the literature, key limitations remain to be addressed: Firstly, robustness, that is, the reliable performance of state-of-the-art methods when run on challenging images (e.g. in the presence of blood, smoke or motion artifacts). Secondly, generalization; algorithms trained for a specific intervention in a specific hospital should generalize to other interventions or institutions. In an effort to promote solutions for these limitations, we organized the Robust Medical Instrument Segmentation (ROBUST-MIS) challenge as an international benchmarking competition with a specific focus on the robustness and generalization capabilities of algorithms. For the first time in the field of endoscopic image processing, our challenge included a task on binary segmentation and also addressed multi-instance detection and segmentation. The challenge was based on a surgical data set comprising 10,040 annotated images acquired from a total of 30 surgical procedures from three different types of surgery. The validation of the competing methods for the three tasks (binary segmentation, multi-instance detection and multi-instance segmentation) was performed in three different stages with an increasing domain gap between the training and the test data. The results confirm the initial hypothesis, namely that algorithm performance degrades with an increasing domain gap. While the average detection and segmentation quality of the best-performing algorithms is high, future research should concentrate on detection and segmentation of small, crossing, moving and transparent instrument(s) (parts).","This challenge has been funded by the Surgical Oncology Program of the National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT) Heidelberg and the project ”OP4.1”, funded by the German Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy (grant number BMWI 01MT17001C).

Our objective was to characterize such quality gaps in public pancreas imaging datasets (PPIDs), to evaluate their impact on previously published studies, and to provide post-hoc labels and segmentations as a value-add for these PPIDs.
METHODS: We scored the available PPIDs on the medical imaging data readiness (MIDaR) scale, and evaluated for associated metadata, image quality, acquisition phase, etiology of pancreas lesion, sources of confounders, and biases. Studies utilizing these PPIDs were evaluated for awareness of and any impact of quality gaps on their results. Volumetric pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDA) segmentations were performed for non-annotated CTs by a junior radiologist (R1) and reviewed by a senior radiologist (R3).
RESULTS: We found three PPIDs with 560 CTs and six MRIs. NIH dataset of normal pancreas CTs (PCT) (n = 80 CTs) had optimal image quality and met MIDaR A criteria but parts of pancreas have been excluded in the provided segmentations. TCIA-PDA (n = 60 CTs; 6 MRIs) and MSD(n = 420 CTs) datasets categorized to MIDaR B due to incomplete annotations, limited metadata, and insufficient documentation. Substantial proportion of CTs from TCIA-PDA and MSD datasets were found unsuitable for AI due to biliary stents [TCIA-PDA:10 (17%); MSD:112 (27%)] or other factors (non-portal venous phase, suboptimal image quality, non-PDA etiology, or post-treatment status) [TCIA-PDA:5 (8.5%); MSD:156 (37.1%)]. These quality gaps were not accounted for in any of the 25 studies that have used these PPIDs (NIH-PCT:20; MSD:1; both: 4). PDA segmentations were done by R1 in 91 eligible CTs (TCIA-PDA:42; MSD:49). Of these, corrections were made by R3 in 16 CTs (18%) (TCIA-PDA:4; MSD:12) [mean (standard deviation) Dice: 0.72(0.21) and 0.63(0.23) respectively].
CONCLUSION: Substantial quality gaps, sources of bias, and high proportion of CTs unsuitable for AI characterize the available limited PPIDs. Published studies on these PPIDs do not account for these quality gaps. We complement these PPIDs through post-hoc labels and segmentations for public release on the TCIA portal. Collaborative efforts leading to large, well-curated PPIDs supported by adequate documentation are critically needed to translate the promise of AI to clinical practice.","Funding Sources: Dr. Goenka acknowledges research grant from the Champions for Hope Pancreatic Cancer Research Program of the Funk-Zitiello Foundation and the Advance the Practice Award from the Department of Radiology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.

Almost all segmentation networks based on deep learning techniques rely on fully annotated data with strong supervision. However, existing public imaging datasets encountered in the RT domain frequently include singly labelled tumors or partially labelled organs because annotating full OARs and tumors in CT images is both rigorous and tedious. To utilize labelled data from different sources, we proposed a dual-path semi-supervised conditional nnU-Net for OARs and tumor segmentation that is trained on a union of partially labelled datasets.
METHODS: The framework employs the nnU-Net as the base model and introduces a conditioning strategy by incorporating auxiliary information as an additional input layer into the decoder. The conditional nnU-Net efficiently leverages prior conditional information to classify the target class at the pixelwise level. Specifically, we employ the uncertainty-aware mean teacher (UA-MT) framework to assist in OARs segmentation, which can effectively leverage unlabelled data (images from a tumor labelled dataset) by encouraging consistent predictions of the same input under different perturbations. Furthermore, we individually design different combinations of loss functions to optimize the segmentation of OARs (Dice loss and cross-entropy loss) and tumors (Dice loss and focal loss) in a dual path.
RESULTS: The proposed method is evaluated on two publicly available datasets of the spinal cord, left and right lung, heart, esophagus, and lung tumor, in which satisfactory segmentation performance has been achieved in term of both the region-based Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and the boundary-based Hausdorff distance (HD).
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed semi-supervised conditional nnU-Net breaks down the barriers between nonoverlapping labelled datasets and further alleviates the problem of ""data hunger"" and ""data waste"" in multi-class segmentation. The method has the potential to help radiologists with RT treatment planning in clinical practice.",This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 81871457) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51775368).,,Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine,,"Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Lung; Lung Neoplasms; Organs at Risk; Tomography, X-Ray Computed",2021-09-15,2021,2021-09-15,2021-11,211,,106419,Closed,Article,"Zhang, Guobin; Yang, Zhiyong; Huo, Bin; Chai, Shude; Jiang, Shan","Zhang, Guobin (School of Mechanical Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin, 300350, China.); Yang, Zhiyong (School of Mechanical Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin, 300350, China.); Huo, Bin (Department of Oncology, Tianjin Medical University Second Hospital, Tianjin, 300211, China.); Chai, Shude (Department of Oncology, Tianjin Medical University Second Hospital, Tianjin, 300211, China.); Jiang, Shan (School of Mechanical Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin, 300350, China.

Purpose To develop and validate a DL-based approach for automatic identification of patients with various solid and cystic pancreatic neoplasms at abdominal CT and compare its diagnostic performance with that of radiologists. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, a three-dimensional nnU-Net-based DL model was trained using the CT data of patients who underwent resection for pancreatic lesions between January 2014 and March 2015 and a subset of patients without pancreatic abnormality who underwent CT in 2014. Performance of the DL-based approach to identify patients with pancreatic lesions was evaluated in a temporally independent cohort (test set 1) and a temporally and spatially independent cohort (test set 2) and was compared with that of two board-certified radiologists. Performance was assessed using receiver operating characteristic analysis. Results The study included 852 patients in the training set (median age, 60 years [range, 19-85 years]; 462 men), 603 patients in test set 1 (median age, 58 years [range, 18-82 years]; 376 men), and 589 patients in test set 2 (median age, 63 years [range, 18-99 years]; 343 men). In test set 1, the DL-based approach had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.91 (95% CI: 0.89, 0.94) and showed slightly worse performance in test set 2 (AUC, 0.87 [95% CI: 0.84, 0.89]). The DL-based approach showed high sensitivity in identifying patients with solid lesions of any size (98%-100%) or cystic lesions measuring 1.0 cm or larger (92%-93%), which was comparable with the radiologists (95%-100% for solid lesions [P = .51 to P > .99]; 93%-98% for cystic lesions ≥1.0 cm [P = .38 to P > .99]). Conclusion The deep learning-based approach demonstrated high performance in identifying patients with various solid and cystic pancreatic lesions at CT. © RSNA, 2022 Online supplemental material is available for this article.","* H.J.P. and K.S. equally contributed to this work. ** N.K. and H.J.K. are co–senior authors.

The use of neural networks with CT imaging can potentially improve clinicians' efficiency in diagnosis. Previous studies in this field have primarily focused on classifying the disease on CT images, while few studies targeted the localisation of disease regions. Developing neural networks for automating the latter task is impeded by limited CT images with pixel-level annotations available to the research community.
METHODS: This paper proposes a weakly-supervised framework named ""Weak Variational Autoencoder for Localisation and Enhancement"" (WVALE) to address this challenge for COVID-19 CT images. This framework includes two components: anomaly localisation with a novel WVAE model and enhancement of supervised segmentation models with WVALE.
RESULTS: The WVAE model have been shown to produce high-quality post-hoc attention maps with fine borders around infection regions, while weak supervision segmentation shows results comparable to conventional supervised segmentation models. The WVALE framework can enhance the performance of a range of supervised segmentation models, including state-of-art models for the segmentation of COVID-19 lung infection.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides a proof-of-concept for weakly supervised segmentation and an alternative approach to alleviate the lack of annotation, while its independence from classification & segmentation frameworks makes it easily integrable with existing systems.","This paper is partially supported by Royal Society International Exchanges Cost Share Award, UK (RP202G0230); Medical Research Council Confidence in Concept Award, UK (MC_PC_17171); Hope Foundation for Cancer Research, UK (RM60G0680); British Heart Foundation Accelerator Award, UK (AA/18/3/34220); Sino-UK Industrial Fund (RP202G0289); Global Challenges Research Fund (GCRF), UK (P202PF11); LIAS Pioneering Partnerships award, UK (P202ED10); Data Science Enhancement Fund, UK (P202RE237 ).",,Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine,,"COVID-19; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Lung; Pandemics; Supervised Machine Learning",2022-05-14,2022,2022-05-14,2022-06,221,,106883,All OA, Bronze,Article,"Zhou, Qinghua; Wang, Shuihua; Zhang, Xin; Zhang, Yu-Dong","Zhou, Qinghua (School of Computing and Mathematical Sciences, University of Leicester, Leicester, LE1 7RH, UK.

In this paper we explore segmentation solutions based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for providing fast, reliable segmentations of lesions and grey-matter structures in multi-modal MR imaging, and the performance of these methods when applied to out-of-centre data. We trained two state-of-the-art fully convolutional CNN architectures on the 2016 MSSEG training dataset, which was annotated by seven independent human raters: a reference implementation of a 3D Unet, and a more recently proposed 3D-to-2D architecture (DeepSCAN). We then retrained those methods on a larger dataset from a single centre, with and without labels for other brain structures. We quantified changes in performance owing to dataset shift, and changes in performance by adding the additional brain-structure labels. We also compared performance with freely available reference methods. Both fully-convolutional CNN methods substantially outperform other approaches in the literature when trained and evaluated in cross-validation on the MSSEG dataset, showing agreement with human raters in the range of human inter-rater variability. Both architectures showed drops in performance when trained on single-centre data and tested on the MSSEG dataset. When trained with the addition of weak anatomical labels derived from Freesurfer, the performance of the 3D Unet degraded, while the performance of the DeepSCAN net improved. Overall, the DeepSCAN network predicting both lesion and anatomical labels was the best-performing network examined.","This research was supported by the Swiss Multiple Sclerosis Society (“Automatic segmentation of MS lesions, brain volumetry and morphometry: Proposal of a diagnostic tool for disease monitoring”) and a grant from the Novartis Forschungsstiftung (“DeepSCAN-Cortex”).",,Scientific Reports,,"Brain; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Multiple Sclerosis; Neural Networks, Computer",2021-01-13,2021,2021-01-13,,11,1,1087,All OA, Gold,Article,"McKinley, Richard; Wepfer, Rik; Aschwanden, Fabian; Grunder, Lorenz; Muri, Raphaela; Rummel, Christian; Verma, Rajeev; Weisstanner, Christian; Reyes, Mauricio; Salmen, Anke; Chan, Andrew; Wagner, Franca; Wiest, Roland","McKinley, Richard (Support Center for Advanced Neuroimaging, University Institute for Diagnostic and Interventional Neuroradiology, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, Bern, Switzerland); Wepfer, Rik (Support Center for Advanced Neuroimaging, University Institute for Diagnostic and Interventional Neuroradiology, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, Bern, Switzerland); Aschwanden, Fabian (Support Center for Advanced Neuroimaging, University Institute for Diagnostic and Interventional Neuroradiology, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, Bern, Switzerland); Grunder, Lorenz (Support Center for Advanced Neuroimaging, University Institute for Diagnostic and Interventional Neuroradiology, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, Bern, Switzerland); Muri, Raphaela (Support Center for Advanced Neuroimaging, University Institute for Diagnostic and Interventional Neuroradiology, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, Bern, Switzerland); Rummel, Christian (Support Center for Advanced Neuroimaging, University Institute for Diagnostic and Interventional Neuroradiology, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, Bern, Switzerland); Verma, Rajeev (Swiss Paraplegic Centre, Nottwil, Switzerland); Weisstanner, Christian (Medizinisch Radiologisches Institut, Zurich, Switzerland); Reyes, Mauricio (ARTORG Centre for Biomedical Engineering Research, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland); Salmen, Anke (University Clinic for Neurology, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, Bern, Switzerland); Chan, Andrew (University Clinic for Neurology, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, Bern, Switzerland); Wagner, Franca (Support Center for Advanced Neuroimaging, University Institute for Diagnostic and Interventional Neuroradiology, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, Bern, Switzerland); Wiest, Roland (Support Center for Advanced Neuroimaging, University Institute for Diagnostic and Interventional Neuroradiology, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, Bern, Switzerland)","McKinley, Richard (University Hospital of Bern)","McKinley, Richard (University Hospital of Bern); Wepfer, Rik (University Hospital of Bern); Aschwanden, Fabian (University Hospital of Bern); Grunder, Lorenz (University Hospital of Bern); Muri, Raphaela (University Hospital of Bern); Rummel, Christian (University Hospital of Bern); Verma, Rajeev (Swiss Paraplegic Center); Weisstanner, Christian (); Reyes, Mauricio (University of Bern); Salmen, Anke (University Hospital of Bern); Chan, Andrew (University Hospital of Bern); Wagner, Franca (University Hospital of Bern); Wiest, Roland (University Hospital of Bern)",31,29,6.58,25.37,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-79925-4.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1134516398,46 Information and Computing Sciences, 4611 Machine Learning,,,,,,,,,,

To alleviate these problems, we introduce deep supervision (DS) and atrous inception (AI) technologies with conditional random field (CRF) and propose three major improvements that are experimentally shown to have substantive and practical value. First, we replace the encoder's standard convolution with the residual block. Residual blocks can increase the depth of the network. Second, we provide an AI module to connect the encoder and decoder. AI allows us to obtain multi-scale features. Third, we incorporate the DS mechanism into the decoder. This helps to make full use of information of the shallow layers. In addition, we employ the Tversky loss function to balance the segmented and non-segmented regions and perform further refinement with a dense CRF. Finally, we extensively validate the proposed method on three public databases: LiTS17, 3DIRCADb, and SLiver07. Compared to the state-of-the-art methods, the proposed method achieved increased segmentation accuracy for the livers with low contrast and the fuzzy boundary between liver tissue and neighboring organs and is, therefore, more suited for automatic segmentation of these livers.","This work is supported by the National Nature Science Foundation (Nos. 61741106, 61701178).",,Scientific Reports,,"Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Liver; Tomography, X-Ray Computed",2022-10-10,2022,2022-10-10,,12,1,16995,All OA, Gold,Article,"Lv, Peiqing; Wang, Jinke; Zhang, Xiangyang; Shi, Changfa","Lv, Peiqing (School of Automation, Harbin University of Science and Technology, 150080, Harbin, China); Wang, Jinke (Department of Software Engineering, Harbin University of Science and Technology, 264300, Rongcheng, China; School of Automation, Harbin University of Science and Technology, 150080, Harbin, China); Zhang, Xiangyang (School of Automation, Harbin University of Science and Technology, 150080, Harbin, China); Shi, Changfa (Mobile E-business Collaborative Innovation Center of Hunan Province, Hunan University of Technology and Business, 410205, Changsha, China)","Wang, Jinke (Harbin University of Science and Technology; Harbin University of Science and Technology)","Lv, Peiqing (Harbin University of Science and Technology); Wang, Jinke (Harbin University of Science and Technology; Harbin University of Science and Technology); Zhang, Xiangyang (Harbin University of Science and Technology); Shi, Changfa (Hunan University of Technology)",0,0,,,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-21562-0.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1151728444,46 Information and Computing Sciences, 4603 Computer Vision and Multimedia Computation,,,,,,,,,,

Late gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (LGE MRI) is an efficient noninvasive technology for imaging the diseased heart. Three-dimensional segmentation of the left atrium (LA) in LGE MRI is a fundamental step for guiding the therapy of patients with AF. However, the low contrast and fuzzy surface of the LA in LGE MRI make accurate and objective LA segmentation a challenge. The purpose of this study is to propose an automatic and efficient LA segmentation model based on a convolutional neural network to obtain a more accurate predicted surface and improve the LA segmentation results.
METHODS: In this study, we proposed an uncertainty-guided symmetric multilevel supervision (SML) network for 3D LA segmentation in LGE MRI. First, we constructed an SML structure to combine the corresponding features from the encoding and decoding stages to learn the multiscale representation of LA. Second, we formulated the discrepancy of predictions of our model as model uncertainty. Then we proposed an uncertainty-guided objective function to further increase the segmentation accuracy on the surface.
RESULTS: We evaluated our proposed model on the public LA segmentation database using four universal metrics. The proposed model achieved Hausdorff Distance (HD) of 11.68 mm, average symmetric surface distance of 0.92 mm, Dice score of 0.92, and Jaccard of 0.85. Compared with state-of-the-art models, our model achieved the best HD that is sensitive to surface accuracy. For the other three metrics, our model also achieved better or comparable performance.
CONCLUSIONS: We proposed an efficient automatic LA segmentation model that consisted of an SML structure and an uncertainty-guided objective function. Compared to other models, we designed an additional supervision branch in the encoding stage to learn more detailed representations of LA while learning global context information through the multilevel structure of each supervision branch. To address the fuzzy surface challenge of LA segmentation in LGE MRI, we leveraged the model uncertainty to enhance the distinguishing ability of the model on the surface, thereby the predicted accuracy of the LA surface can be further increased. We conducted extensive ablation and comparative experiments with state-of-the-art models. The experiment results demonstrated that our proposed model could handle the complex structure of LA and had superior advantages in improving the segmentation performance on the surface.","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grants 62001141 and 62001144; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation under Grants 2021T140162, 2021M690574, and 2020M670911; Heilongjiang Postdoctoral Fund under Grant LBHZ20066; Shandong Provincial Natural Science Foundation (ZR2020MF050); Science and Technology Innovation Committee of Shenzhen Municipality under Grant JCYJ20210324131800002; and Interdisciplinary Research Foundation of HIT under Grant IR2021230.",,Medical Physics,,Atrial Fibrillation, Gadolinium, Heart Atria, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Uncertainty,2022-04-29,2022,2022-04-29,2022-07,49,7,4554-4565,Closed,Article,"Liu, Yashu; Wang, Wei; Luo, Gongning; Wang, Kuanquan; Liang, Dong; Li, Shuo","Liu, Yashu (School of Computer Science and Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China); Wang, Wei (School of Computer Science and Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen, China); Luo, Gongning (School of Computer Science and Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China); Wang, Kuanquan (School of Computer Science and Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China); Liang, Dong (School of Computer Science and Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China); Li, Shuo (Department of Medical Imaging, Western University, London, Ontario, Canada)","Wang, Kuanquan (Harbin Institute of Technology)","Liu, Yashu (Harbin Institute of Technology); Wang, Wei (Harbin Institute of Technology); Luo, Gongning (Harbin Institute of Technology); Wang, Kuanquan (Harbin Institute of Technology); Liang, Dong (Harbin Institute of Technology); Li, Shuo (Western University)",1,1,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1147110982,40 Engineering, 4003 Biomedical Engineering,,,,,,

For organ segmentation from volumetric medical images, human annotation is tedious and inefficient. To save human labour and to accelerate the training process, the strategy of annotation by iterative deep learning recently becomes popular in the research community. However, due to the lack of domain knowledge or efficient human-interaction tools, the current AID methods still suffer from long training time and high annotation burden.MethodsWe develop a contour-based annotation by iterative deep learning (AID) algorithm which uses boundary representation instead of voxel labels to incorporate high-level organ shape knowledge. We propose a contour segmentation network with a multi-scale feature extraction backbone to improve the boundary detection accuracy. We also developed a contour-based human-intervention method to facilitate easy adjustments of organ boundaries. By combining the contour-based segmentation network and the contour-adjustment intervention method, our algorithm achieves fast few-shot learning and efficient human proofreading.ResultsFor validation, two human operators independently annotated four abdominal organs in computed tomography (CT) images using our method and two compared methods, i.e. a traditional contour-interpolation method and a state-of-the-art (SOTA) convolutional network (CNN) method based on voxel label representation. Compared to these methods, our approach considerably saved annotation time and reduced inter-rater variabilities. Our contour detection network also outperforms the SOTA nnU-Net in producing anatomically plausible organ shape with only a small training set.ConclusionTaking advantage of the boundary shape prior and the contour representation, our method is more efficient, more accurate and less prone to inter-operator variability than the SOTA AID methods for organ segmentation from volumetric medical images. The good shape learning ability and flexible boundary adjustment function make it suitable for fast annotation of organ structures with regular shape.","This work was supported in part by the National Key Research and Development Program No. 2020YFB1711500, 2020YFB1711501 and 2020YFB1711503, the general program of National Natural Science Fund of China (No. 81971693, 61971445 and 61971089), Dalian City Science and Technology Innovation Funding (No. 2018J12GX042), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (No. DUT19JC01 and DUT20YG122), the funding of Liaoning Key Lab of IC &amp; BME System and Dalian Engineering Research Center for Artificial Intelligence in Medical Imaging.",,International Journal of Computer Assisted Radiology and Surgery,,"Humans; Deep Learning; Neural Networks, Computer; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Algorithms; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted",2022-09-01,2022,2022-09-01,2023-02,18,2,379-394,All OA, Hybrid,Article,"Zhuang, Mingrui; Chen, Zhonghua; Wang, Hongkai; Tang, Hong; He, Jiang; Qin, Bobo; Yang, Yuxin; Jin, Xiaoxian; Yu, Mengzhu; Jin, Baitao; Li, Taijing; Kettunen, Lauri","Zhuang, Mingrui (School of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China); Chen, Zhonghua (School of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China; Faculty of Information Technology, University of Jyväskylä, Jyväskylä, Finland); Wang, Hongkai (School of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China; Liaoning Key Laboratory of Integrated Circuit and Biomedical Electronic System, Dalian, China); Tang, Hong (School of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China); He, Jiang (School of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China); Qin, Bobo (School of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China); Yang, Yuxin (School of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China); Jin, Xiaoxian (School of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China); Yu, Mengzhu (School of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China); Jin, Baitao (School of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China); Li, Taijing (School of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China); Kettunen, Lauri (Faculty of Information Technology, University of Jyväskylä, Jyväskylä, Finland)","Wang, Hongkai (Dalian University of Technology; )","Zhuang, Mingrui (Dalian University of Technology); Chen, Zhonghua (Dalian University of Technology; University of Jyväskylä); Wang, Hongkai (Dalian University of Technology); Tang, Hong (Dalian University of Technology); He, Jiang (Dalian University of Technology); Qin, Bobo (Dalian University of Technology); Yang, Yuxin (Dalian University of Technology); Jin, Xiaoxian (Dalian University of Technology); Yu, Mengzhu (Dalian University of Technology); Jin, Baitao (Dalian University of Technology); Li, Taijing (Dalian University of Technology); Kettunen, Lauri (University of Jyväskylä)",0,0,,,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11548-022-02730-z.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1150678142,46 Information and Computing Sciences, 4611 Machine Learning,,,,,,,,,,

Segmentation of tumors is a necessary task in the image processing of the gliomas and is important for its timely diagnosis and starting a treatment. Using 3D U-net architecture to perform semantic segmentation on brain tumor dataset is at the core of deep learning. In this paper, we present a unique cloud-based 3D U-Net method to perform brain tumor segmentation using BRATS dataset. The system was effectively trained by using Adam optimization solver by utilizing multiple hyper parameters. We got an average dice score of 95% which makes our method the first cloud-based method to achieve maximum accuracy. The dice score is calculated by using Sørensen-Dice similarity coefficient. We also performed an extensive literature review of the brain tumor segmentation methods implemented in the last five years to get a state-of-the-art picture of well-known methodologies with a higher dice score.

Lung image analysis and segmentation are one of the primary steps used for early diagnosis of cancer. Handcrafted medical imaging segmentation presents a very time-consuming task for radiation oncologists. To address this problem, we propose in this work to develop a full and entire system used for early diagnosis of lung cancer in CT scan imaging. The proposed lung cancer diagnosis system is composed of two main parts: the first part is used for segmentation developed on top of the UNETR network, and the second part is a classification part used to classify the output segmentation part, either benign or malignant, developed on top of the self-supervised network. The proposed system presents a powerful tool for early diagnosing and combatting lung cancer using 3D-input CT scan data. Extensive experiments have been performed to contribute to better segmentation and classification results. Training and testing experiments have been performed using the Decathlon dataset. Experimental results have been conducted to new state-of-the-art performances: segmentation accuracy of 97.83%, and 98.77% as classification accuracy.

2893,pub.1151156692,10.1016/j.cmpb.2022.107147,36206688,,Convolutional bi-directional learning and spatial enhanced attentions for lung tumor segmentation,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Accurate lung tumor segmentation from computed tomography (CT) is complex due to variations in tumor sizes, shapes, patterns and growing locations. Learning semantic and spatial relations between different feature channels, image regions and positions is critical yet challenging.
METHODS: We propose a new segmentation method, PRCS, by learning and integrating multi-channel contextual relations, and spatial and position dependencies across image regions. Firstly, to extract contextual relationships between different deep image feature tensor channels, we propose a new convolutional bi-directional gated recurrent unit based module for forward and backward learning. Secondly, a novel cross-channel region-level attention mechanism is proposed to discriminate the contributions of different local regions and associated features in the global learning process. Finally, spatial and position dependencies are formulated by a new position-enhanced self-attention mechanism. The new attention can measure the diverse contributions of other positions to a target position and obtain an enhanced adaptive feature vector for the target position.
RESULTS: Our model outperformed seven state-of-the-art segmentation methods on both public and in-house lung tumor datasets in terms of spatial overlapping and shape similarity. Ablation study results proved the effectiveness of three technical innovations and generalization ability on different 3D CNN segmentation backbones.
CONCLUSION: The proposed model enhanced the learning and propagation of contextual, spatial and position relations in 3D volumes, improving lung tumours' segmentation performance with large variations and indistinct boundaries. PRCS provides an effective automated approach to support precision diagnosis and treatment planning of lung cancer.","This work is supported by the Natural Science Foundation of China (61972135, 62172143, 8217102892), the Natural Science Foundation of Heilongjiang Province (LH2019A029), the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2019M650069, 2020M670939), and Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province (ZR2019LZL012).",,Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine,,"Humans; Neural Networks, Computer; Deep Learning; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Lung Neoplasms; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted",2022-09-20,2022,2022-09-20,2022-11,226,,107147,Closed,Article,"Xuan, Ping; Jiang, Bin; Cui, Hui; Jin, Qiangguo; Cheng, Peng; Nakaguchi, Toshiya; Zhang, Tiangang; Li, Changyang; Ning, Zhiyu; Guo, Menghan; Wang, Linlin","Xuan, Ping (School of Computer Science and Technology, Heilongjiang University, Harbin, China; Department of Computer Science, School of Engineering, Shantou University, Shantou, China.); Jiang, Bin (School of Computer Science and Technology, Heilongjiang University, Harbin, China.); Cui, Hui (Department of Computer Science and Information Technology, La Trobe University, Melbourne, Australia.); Jin, Qiangguo (School of Software, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi' an, China.); Cheng, Peng (Department of Computer Science and Information Technology, La Trobe University, Melbourne, Australia.); Nakaguchi, Toshiya (Center for Frontier Medical Engineering, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan.); Zhang, Tiangang (School of Mathematical Science, Heilongjiang University, Harbin, China.

2893,pub.1126682708,10.1109/jbhi.2020.2986926,32305947,,Multi-Scale Self-Guided Attention for Medical Image Segmentation,"Even though convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are driving progress in medical image segmentation, standard models still have some drawbacks. First, the use of multi-scale approaches, i.e., encoder-decoder architectures, leads to a redundant use of information, where similar low-level features are extracted multiple times at multiple scales. Second, long-range feature dependencies are not efficiently modeled, resulting in non-optimal discriminative feature representations associated with each semantic class. In this paper we attempt to overcome these limitations with the proposed architecture, by capturing richer contextual dependencies based on the use of guided self-attention mechanisms. This approach is able to integrate local features with their corresponding global dependencies, as well as highlight interdependent channel maps in an adaptive manner. Further, the additional loss between different modules guides the attention mechanisms to neglect irrelevant information and focus on more discriminant regions of the image by emphasizing relevant feature associations. We evaluate the proposed model in the context of semantic segmentation on three different datasets: abdominal organs, cardiovascular structures and brain tumors. A series of ablation experiments support the importance of these attention modules in the proposed architecture. In addition, compared to other state-of-the-art segmentation networks our model yields better segmentation performance, increasing the accuracy of the predictions while reducing the standard deviation. This demonstrates the efficiency of our approach to generate precise and reliable automatic segmentations of medical images.

The segmentation task for MRI to extract the related organs for CVD is essential for diagnosis. Currently, a large number of deep learning methods are designed for medical image segmentation tasks. However, the design of segmentation algorithms tends to have more focus on deepening the network architectures and tuning the parameters and hyperparameters manually, which not only leads to a high time and effort consumption, but also causes the problem that the architectures and setting designed for a single task only performs well in a single dataset, but have low performance in other cases. In this paper, nn-TransUNet, an automatic deep learning pipeline for MRI segmentation of the heart is proposed to combine the experiment planning of nnU-net and the network architecture of TransUNet. nn-TransUNet uses vision transformers and convolution layers in the design of the encoder and takes up convolution layers as decoder. With the adaptive preprocessing and network training plan generated by the proposed automatic experiment planning pipeline, nn-TransUNet is able to fulfill the target of medical image segmentation in heart MRI tasks. nn-TransUNet achieved state-of-the-art level in heart MRI segmentation task on Automatic Cardiac Diagnosis Challenge (ACDC) Dataset.

However, training an accurate and robust segmentation model is still a long-standing challenge due to the time-consuming and expertise-intensive annotations for training data, especially 3-D medical images. Recently, self-supervised learning emerges as a promising approach for unsupervised visual representation learning, showing great potential to alleviate the expertise annotations for medical images. Although global representation learning has attained remarkable results on iconic datasets, such as ImageNet, it can not be applied directly to medical image segmentation, because the segmentation task is non-iconic, and the targets always vary in physical scales. To address these problems, we propose a Multi-scale Visual Representation self-supervised Learning (MsVRL) model, to perform finer-grained representation and deal with different target scales. Specifically, a multi-scale representation conception, a canvas matching method, an embedding pre-sampling module, a center-ness branch, and a cross-level consistent loss are introduced to improve the performance. After pre-trained on unlabeled datasets (RibFrac and part of MSD), MsVRL performs downstream segmentation tasks on labeled datasets (BCV, spleen of MSD, and KiTS).

However, no consensus exists on how to take the necessary measurements from CT image data. We trained and applied a fully automated pipeline embedding a convolutional neural network (CNN), which feeds on 3D CT images to automatically segment the thoracic aorta, detects proximal landing zones (PLZs), and quantifies geometric features that are relevant for TEVAR planning. For 465 CT scans, the thoracic aorta and pulmonary arteries were manually segmented; 395 randomly selected scans with the corresponding ground truth segmentations were used to train a CNN with a 3D U-Net architecture. The remaining 70 scans were used for testing. The trained CNN was embedded within computational geometry processing pipeline which provides aortic metrics of interest for TEVAR planning. The resulting metrics included aortic arch centerline radius of curvature, proximal landing zones (PLZs) maximum diameters, angulation, and tortuosity. These parameters were statistically analyzed to compare standard arches vs. arches with a common origin of the innominate and left carotid artery (CILCA). The trained CNN yielded a mean Dice score of 0.95 and was able to generalize to 9 pathological cases of thoracic aortic aneurysm, providing accurate segmentations. CILCA arches were characterized by significantly greater angulation (p = 0.015) and tortuosity (p = 0.048) in PLZ 3 vs. standard arches. For both arch configurations, comparisons among PLZs revealed statistically significant differences in maximum zone diameters (p < 0.0001), angulation (p < 0.0001), and tortuosity (p < 0.0001).

Spine curvature angle measurement is an important step to assess scoliosis precisely. One way to calculate the angle is using the vertebrae features of the 2-D coronal images to identify the most tilted vertebrae. To do the measurement, the segmentation of the transverse vertebrae is an important step. In this paper, we propose a dual-task ultrasound transverse vertebrae segmentation network (D-TVNet) based on U-Net. First, we arrange an auxiliary shape regularization network to learn the contour segmentation of the bones. It improves the boundary segmentation and anti-interference ability of the U-Net by fusing some of the features of the auxiliary task and the main task. Then, we introduce the atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) module to the end of the down-sampling stage of the main task stream to improve the relative feature extraction ability. To further improve the boundary segmentation, we extendedly fuse the down-sampling output features of the auxiliary network in the ASPP. The experiment results show that the proposed D-TVNet achieves the best dice score of 86.68% and the mean dice score of 86.17% based on cross-validation, which is an improvement of 5.17% over the baseline U-Net.

However, interpretation may be time consuming and prone to intra- and interobserver variability. Here, we evaluate the potential of artificial neural networks (ANN) for automated volumetric assessment of MS disease burden and activity on MRI.MethodsA single-institutional dataset with 334 MS patients (334 MRI exams) was used to develop and train an ANN for automated identification and volumetric segmentation of T2/FLAIR-hyperintense and contrast-enhancing (CE) lesions. Independent testing was performed in a single-institutional longitudinal dataset with 82 patients (266 MRI exams). We evaluated lesion detection performance (F1 scores), lesion segmentation agreement (DICE coefficients), and lesion volume agreement (concordance correlation coefficients [CCC]). Independent evaluation was performed on the public ISBI-2015 challenge dataset.ResultsThe F1 score was maximized in the training set at a detection threshold of 7 mm3 for T2/FLAIR lesions and 14 mm3 for CE lesions. In the training set, mean F1 scores were 0.867 for T2/FLAIR lesions and 0.636 for CE lesions, as compared to 0.878 for T2/FLAIR lesions and 0.715 for CE lesions in the test set. Using these thresholds, the ANN yielded mean DICE coefficients of 0.834 and 0.878 for segmentation of T2/FLAIR and CE lesions in the training set (fivefold cross-validation). Corresponding DICE coefficients in the test set were 0.846 for T2/FLAIR lesions and 0.908 for CE lesions, and the CCC was ≥ 0.960 in each dataset.ConclusionsOur results highlight the capability of ANN for quantitative state-of-the-art assessment of volumetric lesion load on MRI and potentially enable a more accurate assessment of disease burden in patients with MS.Key Points• Artificial neural networks (ANN) can accurately detect and segment both T2/FLAIR and contrast-enhancing MS lesions in MRI data.• Performance of the ANN was consistent in a clinically derived dataset, with patients presenting all possible disease stages in MRI scans acquired from standard clinical routine rather than with high-quality research sequences.• Computer-aided evaluation of MS with ANN could streamline both clinical and research procedures in the volumetric assessment of MS disease burden as well as in lesion detection.",,"Dr. Kickingereder, MBA was supported by the Medical Faculty Heidelberg Postdoc-Program and the Else Kröner-Fresenius Foundation (Else-Kröner Memorial Scholarship).",European Radiology,,"Adult; Brain; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Multiple Sclerosis; Neural Networks, Computer; Reproducibility of Results",2020-01-03,2020,2020-01-03,2020-04,30,4,2356-2364,Closed,Article,"Brugnara, Gianluca; Isensee, Fabian; Neuberger, Ulf; Bonekamp, David; Petersen, Jens; Diem, Ricarda; Wildemann, Brigitte; Heiland, Sabine; Wick, Wolfgang; Bendszus, Martin; Maier-Hein, Klaus; Kickingereder, Philipp","Brugnara, Gianluca (Department of Neuroradiology, University of Heidelberg Medical Center, Heidelberg, Germany); Isensee, Fabian (Medical Image Computing, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany); Neuberger, Ulf (Department of Neuroradiology, University of Heidelberg Medical Center, Heidelberg, Germany); Bonekamp, David (Department of Radiology, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany); Petersen, Jens (Department of Neuroradiology, University of Heidelberg Medical Center, Heidelberg, Germany; Medical Image Computing, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany); Diem, Ricarda (Department of Neurology, University of Heidelberg Medical Center, Heidelberg, Germany); Wildemann, Brigitte (Department of Neurology, University of Heidelberg Medical Center, Heidelberg, Germany); Heiland, Sabine (Department of Neuroradiology, University of Heidelberg Medical Center, Heidelberg, Germany); Wick, Wolfgang (Department of Neurology, University of Heidelberg Medical Center, Heidelberg, Germany; Clinical Cooperation Unit Neurooncology, German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), DKFZ, Heidelberg, Germany); Bendszus, Martin (Department of Neuroradiology, University of Heidelberg Medical Center, Heidelberg, Germany); Maier-Hein, Klaus (Medical Image Computing, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany); Kickingereder, Philipp (Department of Neuroradiology, University of Heidelberg Medical Center, Heidelberg, Germany)","Kickingereder, Philipp (University Hospital Heidelberg)","Brugnara, Gianluca (University Hospital Heidelberg); Isensee, Fabian (German Cancer Research Center); Neuberger, Ulf (University Hospital Heidelberg); Bonekamp, David (German Cancer Research Center); Petersen, Jens (University Hospital Heidelberg; German Cancer Research Center); Diem, Ricarda (University Hospital Heidelberg); Wildemann, Brigitte (University Hospital Heidelberg); Heiland, Sabine (University Hospital Heidelberg); Wick, Wolfgang (University Hospital Heidelberg; German Cancer Research Center); Bendszus, Martin (University Hospital Heidelberg); Maier-Hein, Klaus (German Cancer Research Center); Kickingereder, Philipp (University Hospital Heidelberg)",9,8,1.12,4.41,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1123813569,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences, 3202 Clinical Sciences,,,,,,,,,,,

Hereby, large annotated datasets were employed to reliably segment anatomical structures. To reduce the requirement for annotated training data, self-supervised pre-training strategies on non-annotated data were designed. Especially contrastive learning schemes operating on dense pixel-wise representations have been introduced as an effective tool. In this work, we expand on this strategy and leverage inherent anatomical similarities in medical imaging data. We apply our approach to the task of semantic segmentation in a semi-supervised setting with limited amounts of annotated volumes. Trained alongside a segmentation loss in one single training stage, a contrastive loss aids to differentiate between salient anatomical regions that conform to the available annotations. Our approach builds upon the work of Jabri et al. (2020), who proposed cyclical contrastive random walks (CCRW) for self-supervision on palindromes of video frames. We adapt this scheme to operate on entries of paired embedded image slices. Using paths of cyclical random walks bypasses the need for negative samples, as commonly used in contrastive approaches, enabling the algorithm to discriminate among relevant salient (anatomical) regions implicitly. Further, a multi-level supervision strategy is employed, ensuring adequate representations of local and global characteristics of anatomical structures. The effectiveness of reducing the amount of required annotations is shown on three MRI datasets. A median increase of 8.01 and 5.90 pp in the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) compared to our baseline could be achieved across all three datasets in the case of one and two available annotated examples per dataset.",,"This work was supported in part by Germany’s Excellence Strategy [EXC-Number 2064/1, Project number 390727645].",Computerized Medical Imaging and Graphics,,"Algorithms; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Supervised Machine Learning",2023-01-09,2023,2023-01-09,2023-03,104,,102174,Closed,Article,"Fischer, Marc; Hepp, Tobias; Gatidis, Sergios; Yang, Bin","Fischer, Marc (Institute of Signal Processing and System Theory, University of Stuttgart, 70550 Stuttgart, Germany.

CKS Block can adaptively switch standard convolution to deformable convolution in some appropriate layers to detect irregular objects more efficiently without taking up too much computing resources. SOA Block can automatically generate the optimal anchors based on the size distribution of objects. Compared with other methods, our method achieves splendid detection performance and outperforms other methods on the HPC dataset (more than 1800 T2 MRI slices), achieving the highest AP50 of 78.90%.

2735,pub.1132063197,10.1016/j.media.2020.101884,33246228,,A deep learning framework for pancreas segmentation with multi-atlas registration and 3D level-set,"In this paper, we propose and validate a deep learning framework that incorporates both multi-atlas registration and level-set for segmenting pancreas from CT volume images. The proposed segmentation pipeline consists of three stages, namely coarse, fine, and refine stages. Firstly, a coarse segmentation is obtained through multi-atlas based 3D diffeomorphic registration and fusion. After that, to learn the connection feature, a 3D patch-based convolutional neural network (CNN) and three 2D slice-based CNNs are jointly used to predict a fine segmentation based on a bounding box determined from the coarse segmentation. Finally, a 3D level-set method is used, with the fine segmentation being one of its constraints, to integrate information of the original image and the CNN-derived probability map to achieve a refine segmentation. In other words, we jointly utilize global 3D location information (registration), contextual information (patch-based 3D CNN), shape information (slice-based 2.5D CNN) and edge information (3D level-set) in the proposed framework. These components form our cascaded coarse-fine-refine segmentation framework. We test the proposed framework on three different datasets with varying intensity ranges obtained from different resources, respectively containing 36, 82 and 281 CT volume images. In each dataset, we achieve an average Dice score over 82%, being superior or comparable to other existing state-of-the-art pancreas segmentation algorithms.","The authors would like to thank Benxiang Jiang and Junyan Lyu from Southern University of Science and Technology as well as Mengye Lyu from the University of Hong Kong for their help on this work.

Compared with the standard clinical procedure, it provides a less invasive option for the patients and increases the likelihood of sampling cancerous tissue regions for the subsequent pathology analyses. As a prerequisite to image fusion, segmentation must be achieved from both MRI and TRUS domains. The automatic contour delineation of the prostate gland from TRUS images is a challenging task due to several factors including unclear boundaries, speckle noise, and the variety of prostate anatomical shapes. Automatic methodologies, such as those based on deep learning, require a huge quantity of training data to achieve satisfactory results. In this paper, the authors propose a novel optimization formulation to find the best superellipse, a deformable model that can accurately represent the prostate shape. The advantage of the proposed approach is that it does not require extensive annotations, and can be used independently of the specific transducer employed during prostate biopsies. Moreover, in order to show the clinical applicability of the method, this study also presents a module for the automatic segmentation of the prostate gland from MRI, exploiting the nnU-Net framework. Lastly, segmented contours from both imaging domains are fused with a customized registration algorithm in order to create a tool that can help the physician to perform a targeted prostate biopsy by interacting with the graphical user interface.",,This research received no external funding.,Bioengineering,,,2022-07-26,2022,2022-07-26,,9,8,343,All OA, Gold,Article,"Altini, Nicola;

Most of these models are fully-convolutional networks (FCNs), namely each layer processes the output of the preceding layer with convolution operations. The convolution operation enjoys several important properties such as sparse interactions, parameter sharing, and translation equivariance. Because of these properties, FCNs possess a strong and useful inductive bias for image modeling and analysis. However, they also have certain important shortcomings, such as performing a fixed and pre-determined operation on a test image regardless of its content and difficulty in modeling long-range interactions. In this work we show that a different deep neural network architecture, based entirely on self-attention between neighboring image patches and without any convolution operations, can achieve more accurate segmentations than FCNs. Our proposed model is based directly on the transformer network architecture. Given a 3D image block, our network divides it into non-overlapping 3D patches and computes a 1D embedding for each patch. The network predicts the segmentation map for the block based on the self-attention between these patch embeddings. Furthermore, in order to address the common problem of scarcity of labeled medical images, we propose methods for pre-training this model on large corpora of unlabeled images. Our experiments show that the proposed model can achieve segmentation accuracies that are better than several state of the art FCN architectures on two datasets. Our proposed network can be trained using only tens of labeled images. Moreover, with the proposed pre-training strategies, our network outperforms FCNs when labeled training data is small.","This work was supported in part by the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering and the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) under Award R01EB031849, Award R01NS106030, and Award R01EB032366; in part by the Office of the Director of the NIH under Award S10OD0250111; and in part by a Technological Innovations in Neuroscience Award from the McKnight Foundation.

Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) have recently shown very promising results in brain tumor segmentation tasks; however, DCNN models fail the task when applied to volumes that are different from the training dataset. One of the reasons is due to the lack of data standardization to adjust for different models and MR machines. In this work, a 3D spherical coordinates transform during the pre-processing phase has been hypothesized to improve DCNN models’ accuracy and to allow more generalizable results even when the model is trained on small and heterogeneous datasets and translated into different domains. Indeed, the spherical coordinate system avoids several standardization issues since it works independently of resolution and imaging settings. The model trained on spherical transform pre-processed inputs resulted in superior performance over the Cartesian-input trained model on predicting gliomas’ segmentation on Tumor Core and Enhancing Tumor classes, achieving a further improvement in accuracy by merging the two models together. The proposed model is not resolution-dependent, thus improving segmentation accuracy and theoretically solving some transfer learning problems related to the domain shifting, at least in terms of image resolution in the datasets.Graphical abstract",,,Medical & Biological Engineering & Computing,,"Brain Neoplasms; Glioma; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neural Networks, Computer",2021-11-02,2021,2021-11-02,2022-01,60,1,121-134,All OA, Green,Article,"Russo, Carlo; Liu, Sidong; Di Ieva, Antonio","Russo, Carlo (Computational NeuroSurgery (CNS) Lab, Macquarie Medical School, Faculty of Medicine, Health and Human Science, Macquarie University, 1st floor, 75 Talavera Rd, Macquarie Park, 2109, Sydney, NSW, Australia); Liu, Sidong (Computational NeuroSurgery (CNS) Lab, Macquarie Medical School, Faculty of Medicine, Health and Human Science, Macquarie University, 1st floor, 75 Talavera Rd, Macquarie Park, 2109, Sydney, NSW, Australia; Australian Institute of Health Innovation, Centre for Health Informatics, Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia); Di Ieva, Antonio (Computational NeuroSurgery (CNS) Lab, Macquarie Medical School, Faculty of Medicine, Health and Human Science, Macquarie University, 1st floor, 75 Talavera Rd, Macquarie Park, 2109, Sydney, NSW, Australia)","Russo, Carlo (Macquarie University)","Russo, Carlo (Macquarie University); Liu, Sidong (Macquarie University; Macquarie University); Di Ieva, Antonio (Macquarie University)",7,6,,5.73,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.07090,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1142340126,46 Information and Computing Sciences, 4611 Machine Learning,,,,,,,,,,

Deep learning has been adopted as an effective technique to aid COVID-19 detection and segmentation from computed tomography (CT) images. The major challenge lies in the inadequate public COVID-19 datasets. Recently, transfer learning has become a widely used technique that leverages the knowledge gained while solving one problem and applying it to a different but related problem. However, it remains unclear whether various non-COVID19 lung lesions could contribute to segmenting COVID-19 infection areas and how to better conduct this transfer procedure. This paper provides a way to understand the transferability of non-COVID19 lung lesions and a better strategy to train a robust deep learning model for COVID-19 infection segmentation.
METHODS: Based on a publicly available COVID-19 CT dataset and three public non-COVID19 datasets, we evaluate four transfer learning methods using 3D U-Net as a standard encoder-decoder method. i) We introduce the multi-task learning method to get a multi-lesion pre-trained model for COVID-19 infection. ii) We propose and compare four transfer learning strategies with various performance gains and training time costs. Our proposed Hybrid-encoder Learning strategy introduces a Dedicated-encoder and an Adapted-encoder to extract COVID-19 infection features and general lung lesion features, respectively. An attention-based Selective Fusion unit is designed for dynamic feature selection and aggregation.
RESULTS: Experiments show that trained with limited data, proposed Hybrid-encoder strategy based on multi-lesion pre-trained model achieves a mean DSC, NSD, Sensitivity, F1-score, Accuracy and MCC of 0.704, 0.735, 0.682, 0.707, 0.994 and 0.716, respectively, with better genetalization and lower over-fitting risks for segmenting COVID-19 infection.
CONCLUSIONS: The results reveal the benefits of transferring knowledge from non-COVID19 lung lesions, and learning from multiple lung lesion datasets can extract more general features, leading to accurate and robust pre-trained models. We further show the capability of the encoder to learn feature representations of lung lesions, which improves segmentation accuracy and facilitates training convergence. In addition, our proposed Hybrid-encoder learning method incorporates transferred lung lesion features from non-COVID19 datasets effectively and achieves significant improvement. These findings promote new insights into transfer learning for COVID-19 CT image segmentation, which can also be further generalized to other medical tasks.",,,Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine,,"Algorithms; COVID-19; Databases, Factual; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Lung; SARS-CoV-2; Tomography, X-Ray Computed",2021-02-23,2021,2021-02-23,2021-04,202,,106004,All OA, Bronze,Article,"Wang, Yixin; Zhang, Yao; Liu, Yang; Tian, Jiang; Zhong, Cheng; Shi, Zhongchao; Zhang, Yang; He, Zhiqiang","Wang, Yixin (Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China; AI Lab, Lenovo Research, Beijing, China.); Zhang, Yao (Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China; AI Lab, Lenovo Research, Beijing, China.); Liu, Yang (Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China; AI Lab, Lenovo Research, Beijing, China.); Tian, Jiang (AI Lab, Lenovo Research, Beijing, China.); Zhong, Cheng (AI Lab, Lenovo Research, Beijing, China.); Shi, Zhongchao (AI Lab, Lenovo Research, Beijing, China.); Zhang, Yang (Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China; Lenovo Corporate Research & Development, Lenovo Ltd., Beijing, China.

Only a few studies provided access to the source code, which limits the analysis of the out-of-distribution generalization ability. This study presents Cimatec-CovNet-19, a new light 3D convolutional neural network inspired by the VGG16 architecture that supports COVID-19 identification from chest CT scans. We trained the algorithm with a dataset of 3000 CT Scans (1500 COVID-19-positive) with images from different parts of the world, enhanced with 3000 images obtained with data augmentation techniques. We introduced a novel pre-processing approach to perform a slice-wise selection based solely on the lung CT masks and an empirically chosen threshold for the very first slice. It required only 16 slices from a CT examination to identify COVID-19. The model achieved a recall of 0.88, specificity of 0.88, ROC-AUC of 0.95, PR-AUC of 0.95, and F1-score of 0.88 on a test set with 414 samples (207 COVID-19).

However, it is the most time-consuming step as manual delineation is always required from radiation oncologists. Herein, we propose a lightweight deep learning framework for radiotherapy treatment planning (RTP), named RTP-Net, to promote an automatic, rapid, and precise initialization of whole-body OARs and tumors. Briefly, the framework implements a cascade coarse-to-fine segmentation, with adaptive module for both small and large organs, and attention mechanisms for organs and boundaries. Our experiments show three merits: 1) Extensively evaluates on 67 delineation tasks on a large-scale dataset of 28,581 cases; 2) Demonstrates comparable or superior accuracy with an average Dice of 0.95; 3) Achieves near real-time delineation in most tasks with <2 s. This framework could be utilized to accelerate the contouring process in the All-in-One radiotherapy scheme, and thus greatly shorten the turnaround time of patients.","The study is supported by the following funding: National Natural Science Foundation of China 62131015 (to Dinggang Shen) and 81830056 (to Feng Shi); Key R&amp;D Program of Guangdong Province, China 2021B0101420006 (to Xiaohuan Cao, Dinggang Shen); Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality (STCSM) 21010502600 (to Dinggang Shen).",,Nature Communications,,"Humans; Deep Learning; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Organs at Risk; Neoplasms; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted",2022-11-02,2022,2022-11-02,,13,1,6566,All OA, Gold,Article,"Shi, Feng; Hu, Weigang; Wu, Jiaojiao; Han, Miaofei; Wang, Jiazhou; Zhang, Wei; Zhou, Qing; Zhou, Jingjie; Wei, Ying; Shao, Ying; Chen, Yanbo; Yu, Yue; Cao, Xiaohuan; Zhan, Yiqiang; Zhou, Xiang Sean; Gao, Yaozong; Shen, Dinggang","Shi, Feng (Department of Research and Development, Shanghai United Imaging Intelligence Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China); Hu, Weigang (Department of Radiation Oncology, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center, Shanghai, China; Department of Oncology, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, China); Wu, Jiaojiao (Department of Research and Development, Shanghai United Imaging Intelligence Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China); Han, Miaofei (Department of Research and Development, Shanghai United Imaging Intelligence Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China); Wang, Jiazhou (Department of Radiation Oncology, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center, Shanghai, China; Department of Oncology, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, China); Zhang, Wei (Radiotherapy Business Unit, Shanghai United Imaging Healthcare Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China); Zhou, Qing (Department of Research and Development, Shanghai United Imaging Intelligence Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China); Zhou, Jingjie (Radiotherapy Business Unit, Shanghai United Imaging Healthcare Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China); Wei, Ying (Department of Research and Development, Shanghai United Imaging Intelligence Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China); Shao, Ying (Department of Research and Development, Shanghai United Imaging Intelligence Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China); Chen, Yanbo (Department of Research and Development, Shanghai United Imaging Intelligence Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China); Yu, Yue (Department of Research and Development, Shanghai United Imaging Intelligence Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China); Cao, Xiaohuan (Department of Research and Development, Shanghai United Imaging Intelligence Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China); Zhan, Yiqiang (Department of Research and Development, Shanghai United Imaging Intelligence Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China); Zhou, Xiang Sean (Department of Research and Development, Shanghai United Imaging Intelligence Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China); Gao, Yaozong (Department of Research and Development, Shanghai United Imaging Intelligence Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China); Shen, Dinggang (School of Biomedical Engineering, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China; Department of Research and Development, Shanghai United Imaging Intelligence Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China; Shanghai Clinical Research and Trial Center, Shanghai, China)","Gao, Yaozong ; Shen, Dinggang (ShanghaiTech University; ; Shanghai Clinical Research Center)","Shi, Feng (); Hu, Weigang (Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center; Shanghai Medical College of Fudan University); Wu, Jiaojiao (); Han, Miaofei (); Wang, Jiazhou (Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center; Shanghai Medical College of Fudan University); Zhang, Wei (United Imaging Healthcare (China)); Zhou, Qing (); Zhou, Jingjie (United Imaging Healthcare (China)); Wei, Ying (); Shao, Ying (); Chen, Yanbo (); Yu, Yue (); Cao, Xiaohuan (); Zhan, Yiqiang (); Zhou, Xiang Sean (); Gao, Yaozong (); Shen, Dinggang (ShanghaiTech University; Shanghai Clinical Research Center)",0,0,,,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-34257-x.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1152410243,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences, 3211 Oncology and Carcinogenesis, 51 Physical Sciences, 5105 Medical and Biological Physics,,,,,,,,

2714,pub.1153171629,10.1109/jbhi.2022.3225205,36441878,,FCSN: Global Context Aware Segmentation by Learning the Fourier Coefficients of Objects in Medical Images,"The encoder-decoder model is a commonly used Deep Neural Network (DNN) model for medical image segmentation. Conventional encoder-decoder models make pixel-wise predictions focusing heavily on local patterns around the pixel. This makes it challenging to give segmentation that preserves the object's shape and topology, which often requires an understanding of the global context. In this work, we propose a Fourier Coefficient Segmentation Network (FCSN)-a novel global context-aware DNN model that segments an object by learning the complex Fourier coefficients of the object's masks. The Fourier coefficients are calculated by integrating over the whole contour. Therefore, for our model to make a precise estimation of the coefficients, the model is motivated to incorporate the global context of the object, leading to a more accurate segmentation of the object's shape. This global context awareness also makes our model robust to unseen local perturbations during inference, such as additive noise or motion blur that are prevalent in medical images. We compare FCSN with other state-of-the-art global context-aware models (UNet++, DeepLabV3+, UNETR) on 5 medical image segmentation tasks, of which 3 are camera imaging datasets (ISIC_2018, RIM_CUP, RIM_DISC) and 2 are medical imaging datasets (PROSTATE, FETAL). When FCSN is compared with UNETR, FCSN attains significantly lower Hausdorff scores with 19.14 (6%), 17.42 (6%), 9.16 (14%), 11.18 (22%), and 5.98 (6%) for ISIC_2018, RIM_CUP, RIM_DISC, PROSTATE, and FETAL tasks respectively. Moreover, FCSN is lightweight by discarding the decoder module, which incurs significant computational overhead. FCSN only requires 29.7 M parameters which are 75.6 M and 9.9 M fewer parameters than UNETR and DeepLabV3+, respectively. FCSN attains inference and training speeds of 1.6 ms/img and 6.3 ms/img, which is 8× and 3× faster than UNet and UNETR.

2714,pub.1146412527,10.1016/j.media.2021.102342,35354108,,A dual meta-learning framework based on idle data for enhancing segmentation of pancreatic cancer,"Automated segmentation of pancreatic cancer is vital for clinical diagnosis and treatment. However, the small size and inconspicuous boundaries limit the segmentation performance, which is further exacerbated for deep learning techniques with the few training samples due to the high threshold of image acquisition and annotation. To alleviate this issue caused by the small-scale dataset, we collect idle multi-parametric MRIs of pancreatic cancer from different studies to construct a relatively large dataset for enhancing the CT pancreatic cancer segmentation. Therefore, we propose a deep learning segmentation model with the dual meta-learning framework for pancreatic cancer. It can integrate the common knowledge of tumors obtained from idle MRIs and salient knowledge from CT images, making high-level features more discriminative. Specifically, the random intermediate modalities between MRIs and CT are first generated to smoothly fill in the gaps in visual appearance and provide rich intermediate representations for ensuing meta-learning scheme. Subsequently, we employ intermediate modalities-based model-agnostic meta-learning to capture and transfer commonalities. At last, a meta-optimizer is utilized to adaptively learn the salient features within CT data, thus alleviating the interference due to internal differences. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrated our method achieved the promising segmentation performance, with a max Dice score of 64.94% on our private dataset, and outperformed state-of-the-art methods on a public pancreatic cancer CT dataset. The proposed method is an effective pancreatic cancer segmentation framework, which can be easily integrated into other segmentation networks and thus promises to be a potential paradigm for alleviating data scarcity challenges using idle data.","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 62171273), Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai (No. 22ZR1432100), Innovation Research Plan from the Shanghai Municipal Education Commission (No. WF220408215, ZXWF082101/072), Med-Engineering Crossing Foundation from Shanghai Jiao Tong University (No. AH0820009).",,Medical Image Analysis,,"Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Pancreatic Neoplasms",2022-03-19,2022,2022-03-19,2022-05,78,,102342,Closed,Article,"Li, Jun; Qi, Liang; Chen, Qingzhong; Zhang, Yu-Dong; Qian, Xiaohua","Li, Jun (School of Biomedical Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200030, China.); Qi, Liang (Department of Radiology, the First Affiliated Hospital with Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 210009, China.); Chen, Qingzhong (School of Biomedical Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200030, China.); Zhang, Yu-Dong (Department of Radiology, the First Affiliated Hospital with Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 210009, China.); Qian, Xiaohua (School of Biomedical Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200030, China.

The development of automatic segmentation systems from multi-phase CT for splenic vascular injury can augment severity grading for improving clinical decision support and outcome prediction. However, accurate segmentation of splenic vascular injury is challenging for the following reasons: 1) Splenic vascular injury can be highly variant in shape, texture, size, and overall appearance; and 2) Data acquisition is a complex and expensive procedure that requires intensive efforts from both data scientists and radiologists, which makes large-scale well-annotated datasets hard to acquire in general. In light of these challenges, we hereby design a novel framework for multi-phase splenic vascular injury segmentation, especially with limited data. On the one hand, we propose to leverage external data to mine pseudo splenic masks as the spatial attention, dubbed external attention, for guiding the segmentation of splenic vascular injury. On the other hand, we develop a synthetic phase augmentation module, which builds upon generative adversarial networks, for populating the internal data by fully leveraging the relation between different phases. By jointly enforcing external attention and populating internal data representation during training, our proposed method outperforms other competing methods and substantially improves the popular DeepLab-v3+ baseline by more than 7% in terms of average DSC, which confirms its effectiveness.",,This work was supported by the University of Maryland Accelerated Translational Incubator Pilot (ATIP) Program under Grant NIH K08 EB027141-01A1.,IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging,,"Abdomen; Attention; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Spleen; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Vascular System Injuries",2022-06-01,2022,2022-06-01,2022-06,41,6,1346-1357,All OA, Green,Article,"Zhou, Yuyin; Dreizin, David; Wang, Yan; Liu, Fengze; Shen, Wei; Yuille, Alan L.","Zhou, Yuyin (Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of California at Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA, 95064, USA); Dreizin, David (R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center, Department of Radiology, University of Maryland at Baltimore, Baltimore, MD, 21201, USA); Wang, Yan (Shanghai Key Laboratory of Multidimensional Information Processing, East China Normal University, Shanghai, 200241, China); Liu, Fengze (Department of Computer Science, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, 21218, USA); Shen, Wei (MoE Key Laboratory of Artificial Intelligence, AI Institute, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, 200240, China); Yuille, Alan L.

Brain tumors are typically classified into two main groups: benign and malignant tumors. The most common tumor type among malignant brain tumors is known as glioma. In the diagnosis of glioma, different imaging technologies could be used. Among these techniques, MRI is the most preferred imaging technology due to its high-resolution image data. However, the detection of gliomas from a huge set of MRI data could be challenging for the practitioners. In order to solve this concern, many Deep Learning (DL) models based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been proposed to be used in detecting glioma. However, understanding which CNN architecture would work efficiently under various conditions including development environment or programming aspects as well as performance analysis has not been studied so far. In this research work, therefore, the purpose is to investigate the impact of two major programming environments (namely, MATLAB and Python) on the accuracy of CNN-based glioma detection from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images. To this end, experiments on the Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) dataset (2016 and 2017) consisting of multiparametric magnetic MRI images are performed by implementing two popular CNN architectures, the three-dimensional (3D) U-Net and the V-Net in the programming environments. From the results, it is concluded that the use of Python with Google Colaboratory (Colab) might be highly useful in the implementation of CNN-based models for glioma detection. Moreover, the 3D U-Net model is found to perform better, attaining a high accuracy on the dataset. The authors believe that the results achieved from this study would provide useful information to the research community in their appropriate implementation of DL approaches for brain tumor detection.",Authors would like to thank students of Atilim University for their voluntary contribution to this study.,This work was supported by Atilim University Undergraduate Research Projects: [Grant Number ATU-LAP-2021-05].,Diagnostics,,,2023-02-09,2023,2023-02-09,,13,4,651,All OA, Gold,Article,"Yilmaz, Vadi Su; Akdag, Metehan; Dalveren, Yaser; Doruk, Resat Ozgur; Kara, Ali; Soylu, Ahmet","Yilmaz, Vadi Su (Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Atilim University, Kizilcasar Mahallesi, Incek Golbasi, Ankara 06830, Turkey); Akdag, Metehan (Fonet Information Technologies, Kizilirmak Mahallesi, Cukurambar Cankaya, Ankara 06520, Turkey); Dalveren, Yaser (Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Atilim University, Kizilcasar Mahallesi, Incek Golbasi, Ankara 06830, Turkey); Doruk, Resat Ozgur (Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Atilim University, Kizilcasar Mahallesi, Incek Golbasi, Ankara 06830, Turkey); Kara, Ali (Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Gazi University, Eti Mahallesi, Yukselis Sokak, Maltepe, Ankara 06570, Turkey); Soylu, Ahmet (Department of Computer Science, OsloMet—Oslo Metropolitan University, Pilestredet 35, Oslo 0167, Norway)","Kara, Ali (Gazi University)","Yilmaz, Vadi Su (Atilim University); Akdag, Metehan (); Dalveren, Yaser (Atilim University); Doruk, Resat Ozgur (Atilim University); Kara, Ali (Gazi University); Soylu, Ahmet (OsloMet – Oslo Metropolitan University)",0,0,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4418/13/4/651/pdf?version=1675939489,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1155321550,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences, 3211 Oncology and Carcinogenesis,,,,,,,,,,

Automatic tools are often tailored toward specific patient cohorts, and it is unclear how they behave in other clinical settings.
PURPOSE: To evaluate the performance of the open-source Multi-Planar U-Net (MPUnet), the validated Knee Imaging Quantification (KIQ) framework, and a state-of-the-art two-dimensional (2D) U-Net architecture on three clinical cohorts without extensive adaptation of the algorithms.
STUDY TYPE: Retrospective cohort study.
SUBJECTS: A total of 253 subjects (146 females, 107 males, ages 57 ± 12 years) from three knee osteoarthritis (OA) studies (Center for Clinical and Basic Research [CCBR], Osteoarthritis Initiative [OAI], and Prevention of OA in Overweight Females [PROOF]) with varying demographics and OA severity (64/37/24/53/2 scans of Kellgren and Lawrence [KL] grades 0-4).
FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: 0.18 T, 1.0 T/1.5 T, and 3 T sagittal three-dimensional fast-spin echo T1w and dual-echo steady-state sequences.
ASSESSMENT: All models were fit without tuning to knee magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans with manual segmentations from three clinical cohorts. All models were evaluated across KL grades.
STATISTICAL TESTS: Segmentation performance differences as measured by Dice coefficients were tested with paired, two-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank statistics with significance threshold α = 0.05.
RESULTS: The MPUnet performed superior or equal to KIQ and 2D U-Net on all compartments across three cohorts. Mean Dice overlap was significantly higher for MPUnet compared to KIQ and U-Net on CCBR ( 0.83±0.04 vs. 0.81±0.06 and 0.82±0.05 ), significantly higher than KIQ and U-Net OAI ( 0.86±0.03 vs. 0.84±0.04 and 0.85±0.03) , and not significantly different from KIQ while significantly higher than 2D U-Net on PROOF ( 0.78±0.07 vs. 0.77±0.07 , P=0.10 , and 0.73±0.07) . The MPUnet performed significantly better on N=22 KL grade 3 CCBR scans with 0.78±0.06 vs. 0.75±0.08 for KIQ and 0.76±0.06 for 2D U-Net.
DATA CONCLUSION: The MPUnet matched or exceeded the performance of state-of-the-art knee MRI segmentation models across cohorts of variable sequences and patient demographics. The MPUnet required no manual tuning making it both accurate and easy-to-use.

Even though CNN based techniques have achieved great success in medical image segmentation, the expensive annotation, large memory consumption, and insufficient generalization ability still pose challenges to their application in clinical practice, especially in the case of 3D segmentation from high-resolution and large-dimension volumetric imaging. In this paper, we propose a few-shot learning framework by combining ideas of semi-supervised learning and self-training for whole heart segmentation and achieve promising accuracy with a Dice score of 0.890 and a Hausdorff distance of 18.539 mm with only four labeled data for training. When more labeled data provided, the model can generalize better across institutions. The key to success lies in the selection and evolution of high-quality pseudo labels in cascaded learning. A shape-constrained network is built to assess the quality of pseudo labels, and the self-training stages with alternative global-local perspectives are employed to improve the pseudo labels. We evaluate our method on the CTA dataset of the MM-WHS 2017 Challenge and a larger multi-center dataset. In the experiments, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods significantly and has great generalization ability on the unseen data. We also demonstrate, by a study of two 4D (3D+T) CTA data, the potential of our method to be applied in clinical practice.","This work was supported in part by the Beijing Nova Program under Grant Z201100006820064, in part by the National Key Research and Development Project of China under Grant 2020YFC2004800, in part by the STCSMunder Grant 19511121400, and in part by the Beijing Postdoctoral Research Foundation.",,IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging,,"Heart; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Supervised Machine Learning",2021-09-30,2021,2021-09-30,2021-10,40,10,2629-2641,Closed,Article,"Wang, Wenji; Xia, Qing; Hu, Zhiqiang; Yan, Zhennan; Li, Zhuowei; Wu, Yang; Huang, Ning; Gao, Yue; Metaxas, Dimitris; Zhang, Shaoting","Wang, Wenji (SenseTime Research, Beijing, 100080, China); Xia, Qing (SenseTime Research, Beijing, 100080, China; Department of Software, Tsinghua University, Beijing, 100084, China); Hu, Zhiqiang (SenseTime Research, Beijing, 100080, China); Yan, Zhennan (SenseBrain Technology Limited LLC, Princeton, NJ, 08540, USA); Li, Zhuowei (SenseTime Research, Beijing, 100080, China); Wu, Yang (Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, 100853, China); Huang, Ning (SenseTime Research, Beijing, 100080, China); Gao, Yue (Department of Software, Tsinghua University, Beijing, 100084, China); Metaxas, Dimitris (Department of Computer Science, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ, 08854, USA); Zhang, Shaoting (SenseTime Research, Shanghai, 200233, China; Qing Yuan Research Institute, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, 200240, China)","Xia, Qing (; Tsinghua University)","Wang, Wenji (); Xia, Qing (Tsinghua University); Hu, Zhiqiang (); Yan, Zhennan (); Li, Zhuowei (); Wu, Yang (Chinese PLA General Hospital); Huang, Ning (); Gao, Yue (Tsinghua University); Metaxas, Dimitris (Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey); Zhang, Shaoting (Shanghai Jiao Tong University)",16,16,1.87,13.1,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1134740668,46 Information and Computing Sciences, 4611 Machine Learning,,,,,,,,,,,
2563,pub.1140386802,10.1109/tmi.2021.3104460,34383646,,Model-Driven Deep Learning Method for Pancreatic Cancer Segmentation Based on Spiral-Transformation,"Pancreatic cancer is a lethal malignant tumor with one of the worst prognoses. Accurate segmentation of pancreatic cancer is vital in clinical diagnosis and treatment. Due to the unclear boundary and small size of cancers, it is challenging to both manually annotate and automatically segment cancers. Considering 3D information utilization and small sample sizes, we propose a model-driven deep learning method for pancreatic cancer segmentation based on spiral transformation. Specifically, a spiral-transformation algorithm with uniform sampling was developed to map 3D images onto 2D planes while preserving the spatial relationship between textures, thus addressing the challenge in effectively applying 3D contextual information in a 2D model. This study is the first to introduce spiral transformation in a segmentation task to provide effective data augmentation, alleviating the issue of small sample size. Moreover, a transformation-weight-corrected module was embedded into the deep learning model to unify the entire framework. It can achieve 2D segmentation and corresponding 3D rebuilding constraint to overcome non-unique 3D rebuilding results due to the uniform and dense sampling. A smooth regularization based on rebuilding prior knowledge was also designed to optimize segmentation results. The extensive experiments showed that the proposed method achieved a promising segmentation performance on multi-parametric MRIs, where T2, T1, ADC, DWI images obtained the DSC of 65.6%, 64.0%, 64.5%, 65.3%, respectively. This method can provide a novel paradigm to efficiently apply 3D information and augment sample sizes in the development of artificial intelligence for cancer segmentation.

A patient-specific 3D anatomical model of those structures, namely the neurovascular bundles (NVB) and the external urethral sphincters (EUS), can enable physicians to perform such assessments intuitively. As a crucial step to generate
 a patient-specific anatomical model from preoperative MRI in a clinical routine, we propose a multi-class automatic segmentation based on an anisotropic convolutional network. Our specific challenge is to train the network model on a unique source dataset only available at a single clinical site and deploy it to another target site without sharing the original images or labels. As network models trained on data from a single source suffer from quality loss due to the domain shift, we propose a semi-supervised domain adaptation (DA) method to refine the model’s performance in the target domain. Our DA method combines transfer learning and uncertainty guided self-learning based on deep ensembles. Experiments on the segmentation of the prostate, NVB, and EUS, show significant performance gain with the combination of those techniques compared to pure TL and the combination of TL with simple self-learning (p<0.005\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

In this paper, we improve existing approaches for semi-supervised segmentation with a self-paced and self-consistent co-training method. To help distillate information from unlabeled images, we first design a self-paced learning strategy for co-training that lets jointly-trained neural networks focus on easier-to-segment regions first, and then gradually consider harder ones. This is achieved via an end-to-end differentiable loss in the form of a generalized Jensen Shannon Divergence (JSD). Moreover, to encourage predictions from different networks to be both consistent and confident, we enhance this generalized JSD loss with an uncertainty regularizer based on entropy. The robustness of individual models is further improved using a self-ensembling loss that enforces their prediction to be consistent across different training iterations. We demonstrate the potential of our method on three challenging image segmentation problems with different image modalities, using a small fraction of labeled data. Results show clear advantages in terms of performance compared to the standard co-training baselines and recently proposed state-of-the-art approaches for semi-supervised segmentation.","This work was supported in part by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) Discovery Grants Program under grant RGPIN-2018-05715;by the NSFC-Zhejiang Joint Fund of the Integration of Informatization and Industrialization under Grant No.U1909210, the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant (No.61772312).",,Medical Image Analysis,,"Entropy; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Neural Networks, Computer; Supervised Machine Learning; Uncertainty",2021-06-26,2021,2021-06-26,2021-10,73,,102146,All OA, Green,Article,"Wang, Ping; Peng, Jizong; Pedersoli, Marco; Zhou, Yuanfeng; Zhang, Caiming; Desrosiers, Christian","Wang, Ping (Department of Software and IT Engineering, Ecole de technologie supérieure, Montreal, H3C1K3, Canada.

It has been automatically performed by using fully convolutional networks. However, it suffers from the class imbalance problem. To address this problem, we investigated how loss weighting strategies work for brain structure segmentation tasks with different class imbalance situations on MR images. In this study, we adopted segmentation tasks of the cerebrum, cerebellum, brainstem, and blood vessels from MR cisternography and angiography images as the target segmentation tasks. We used a U-net architecture with cross-entropy and Dice loss functions as a baseline and evaluated the effect of the following loss weighting strategies: inverse frequency weighting, median inverse frequency weighting, focal weighting, distance map-based weighting, and distance penalty term-based weighting. In the experiments, the Dice loss function with focal weighting showed the best performance and had a high average Dice score of 92.8% in the binary-class segmentation tasks, while the cross-entropy loss functions with distance map-based weighting achieved the Dice score of up to 93.1% in the multi-class segmentation tasks. The results suggested that the distance map-based and the focal weightings could boost the performance of cross-entropy and Dice loss functions in class imbalanced segmentation tasks, respectively.",,,Healthcare,,,2021-07-26,2021,2021-07-26,,9,8,938,All OA, Gold,Article,"Sugino, Takaaki; Kawase, Toshihiro; Onogi, Shinya; Kin, Taichi; Saito, Nobuhito; Nakajima, Yoshikazu","Sugino, Takaaki (Department of Biomedical Information, Institute of Biomaterials and Bioengineering, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo 101-0062, Japan;, kawase.bmi@tmd.ac.jp, (T.K.);, onogi.bmi@tmd.ac.jp, (S.O.)); Kawase, Toshihiro (Department of Biomedical Information, Institute of Biomaterials and Bioengineering, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo 101-0062, Japan;, kawase.bmi@tmd.ac.jp, (T.K.);, onogi.bmi@tmd.ac.jp, (S.O.)); Onogi, Shinya (Department of Biomedical Information, Institute of Biomaterials and Bioengineering, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo 101-0062, Japan;, kawase.bmi@tmd.ac.jp, (T.K.);, onogi.bmi@tmd.ac.jp, (S.O.)); Kin, Taichi (Department of Neurosurgery, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo 113-0033, Japan;, tkin-tky@g.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp, (T.K.);, nsaito-nsu@m.u-tokyo.ac.jp, (N.S.)); Saito, Nobuhito (Department of Neurosurgery, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo 113-0033, Japan;, tkin-tky@g.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp, (T.K.);, nsaito-nsu@m.u-tokyo.ac.jp, (N.S.)); Nakajima, Yoshikazu (Department of Biomedical Information, Institute of Biomaterials and Bioengineering, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo 101-0062, Japan;, kawase.bmi@tmd.ac.jp, (T.K.);, onogi.bmi@tmd.ac.jp, (S.O.))","Sugino, Takaaki (Tokyo Medical and Dental University; ); Nakajima, Yoshikazu (Tokyo Medical and Dental University; )","Sugino, Takaaki (Tokyo Medical and Dental University); Kawase, Toshihiro (Tokyo Medical and Dental University); Onogi, Shinya (Tokyo Medical and Dental University); Kin, Taichi (University of Tokyo); Saito, Nobuhito (University of Tokyo); Nakajima, Yoshikazu (Tokyo Medical and Dental University)",14,14,2.87,,https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9032/9/8/938/pdf?version=1627287999,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1139954843,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences, 42 Health Sciences,,,,,,,,,,

Medical imaging-focusing on particular parts of the body for defined clinical purposes-generates images of great similarity in anatomy across patients and yields sophisticated anatomical patterns across images, which are associated with rich semantics about human anatomy and which are natural visual words. We show that these visual words can be automatically harvested according to anatomical consistency via self-discovery, and that the self-discovered visual words can serve as strong yet free supervision signals for deep models to learn semantics-enriched generic image representation via self-supervision (self-classification and self-restoration). Our extensive experiments demonstrate the annotation efficiency of TransVW by offering higher performance and faster convergence with reduced annotation cost in several applications. Our TransVW has several important advantages, including (1) TransVW is a fully autodidactic scheme, which exploits the semantics of visual words for self-supervised learning, requiring no expert annotation; (2) visual word learning is an add-on strategy, which complements existing self-supervised methods, boosting their performance; and (3) the learned image representation is semantics-enriched models, which have proven to be more robust and generalizable, saving annotation efforts for a variety of applications through transfer learning.

Unfortunately, segmenting the entire bowel in CT images is quite challenging due to unclear boundary, large shape, size, and appearance variations, as well as diverse filling status within the bowel. In this paper, we present a novel two-stage framework, named BowelNet, to handle the challenging task of bowel segmentation in CT images, with two stages of 1) jointly localizing all types of the bowel, and 2) finely segmenting each type of the bowel. Specifically, in the first stage, we learn a unified localization network from both partially- and fully-labeled CT images to robustly detect all types of the bowel. To better capture unclear bowel boundary and learn complex bowel shapes, in the second stage, we propose to jointly learn semantic information (i.e., bowel segmentation mask) and geometric representations (i.e., bowel boundary and bowel skeleton) for fine bowel segmentation in a multi-task learning scheme. Moreover, we further propose to learn a meta segmentation network via pseudo labels to improve segmentation accuracy. By evaluating on a large abdominal CT dataset, our proposed BowelNet method can achieve Dice scores of 0.764, 0.848, 0.835, 0.774, and 0.824 in segmenting the duodenum, jejunum-ileum, colon, sigmoid, and rectum, respectively.

2320,pub.1144719050,10.1016/j.compbiomed.2022.105237,35074737,,Segmenting pediatric optic pathway gliomas from MRI using deep learning,"Optic pathway gliomas are low-grade neoplastic lesions that account for approximately 3-5% of brain tumors in children. Assessing tumor burden from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plays a central role in its efficient management, yet it is a challenging and human-dependent task due to the difficult and error-prone process of manual segmentation of such lesions, as they can easily manifest different location and appearance characteristics. In this paper, we tackle this issue and propose a fully-automatic and reproducible deep learning algorithm built upon the recent advances in the field which is capable of detecting and segmenting optical pathway gliomas from MRI. The proposed training strategies help us elaborate well-generalizing deep models even in the case of limited ground-truth MRIs presenting example optic pathway gliomas. The rigorous experimental study, performed over two clinical datasets of 22 and 51 multi-modal MRIs acquired for 22 and 51 patients with optical pathway gliomas, and a public dataset of 494 pre-surgery low-/high-grade glioma patients (corresponding to 494 multi-modal MRIs), and involving quantitative, qualitative and statistical analysis revealed that the suggested technique can not only effectively delineate optic pathway gliomas, but can also be applied for detecting other brain tumors. The experiments indicate high agreement between automatically calculated and ground-truth volumetric measurements of the tumors and very fast operation of the proposed approach, both of which can increase the clinical utility of the suggested software tool. Finally, our deep architectures have been made open-sourced to ensure full reproducibility of the method over other MRI data.","JN was partially supported by the Silesian University of Technology grant for maintaining and developing research potential.

Deep convolutional networks have become a promising approach in segmenting ABUS images. However, designing an effective network architecture is time-consuming, and highly relies on specialist's experience and prior knowledge. To address this issue, we introduce a searchable segmentation network (denoted as Auto-DenseUNet) based on the neural architecture search (NAS) to search the optimal architecture automatically for the ABUS mass segmentation task. Concretely, a novel search space is designed based on a densely connected structure to enhance the gradient and information flows throughout the network. Then, to encourage multiscale information fusion, a set of searchable multiscale aggregation nodes between the down-sampling and up-sampling parts of the network are further designed. Thus, all the operators within the dense connection structure or between any two aggregation nodes can be searched to find the optimal structure. Finally, a novel decoupled search training strategy during architecture search is also introduced to alleviate the memory limitation caused by continuous relaxation in NAS. The proposed Auto-DenseUNet method has been evaluated on our ABUS dataset with 170 volumes (from 107 patients), including 120 training volumes and 50 testing volumes split at patient level. Experimental results on testing volumes show that our searched architecture performed better than several human-designed segmentation models on the 3D ABUS mass segmentation task, indicating the effectiveness of our proposed method.",,,Medical Image Analysis,,"Humans; Female; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Ultrasonography, Mammary; Neural Networks, Computer; Breast; Breast Neoplasms; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted",2022-08-23,2022,2022-08-23,2022-11,82,,102589,Closed,Article,"Cao, Xuyang; Chen, Houjin; Li, Yanfeng; Peng, Yahui; Zhou, Yue; Cheng, Lin; Liu, Tianming; Shen, Dinggang","Cao, Xuyang (School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, 100044, China.); Chen, Houjin (School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, 100044, China.); Li, Yanfeng (School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, 100044, China.

However, high-throughput biomedical image registration remains challenging due to inherent variations in the intensity, texture, and anatomy resulting from different imaging modalities, different sample preparation methods, or different developmental stages of the imaged subject. Recently, Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) have attracted increasing interest in both mono- and cross-modal biomedical image registrations due to their special ability to eliminate the modal variance and their adversarial training strategy. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of the GAN-based mono- and cross-modal biomedical image registration methods.

2307,pub.1148154979,10.1016/j.media.2022.102491,35653902,,Prior-aware autoencoders for lung pathology segmentation.,"Segmentation of lung pathology in Computed Tomography (CT) images is of great importance for lung disease screening. However, the presence of different types of lung pathologies with a wide range of heterogeneities in size, shape, location, and texture, on one side, and their visual similarity with respect to surrounding tissues, on the other side, make it challenging to perform reliable automatic lesion segmentation. To leverage segmentation performance, we propose a deep learning framework comprising a Normal Appearance Autoencoder (NAA) model to learn the distribution of healthy lung regions and reconstruct pathology-free images from the corresponding pathological inputs by replacing the pathological regions with the characteristics of healthy tissues. Detected regions that represent prior information regarding the shape and location of pathologies are then integrated into a segmentation network to guide the attention of the model into more meaningful delineations. The proposed pipeline was tested on three types of lung pathologies, including pulmonary nodules, Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC), and Covid-19 lesion on five comprehensive datasets. The results show the superiority of the proposed prior model, which outperformed the baseline segmentation models in all the cases with significant margins. On average, adding the prior model improved the Dice coefficient for the segmentation of lung nodules by 0.038, NSCLCs by 0.101, and Covid-19 lesions by 0.041. We conclude that the proposed NAA model produces reliable prior knowledge regarding the lung pathologies, and integrating such knowledge into a prior segmentation network leads to more accurate delineations.",,,Medical Image Analysis,,"COVID-19; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Lung; Lung Neoplasms; Tomography, X-Ray Computed",2022-05-25,2022,2022-05-25,2022-08,80,,102491,All OA, Hybrid,Article,"Astaraki, Mehdi; Smedby, Örjan; Wang, Chunliang","Astaraki, Mehdi (Department of Biomedical Engineering and Healthy Systems, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Huddinge SE-14157, Sweden; Department of Oncology-Pathology, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska Universitetssjukhuset, Solna, Stockholm SE-17176, Sweden.

In this work, we investigate the single-source domain generalization problem: training a deep network that is robust to unseen domains, under the condition that training data are only available from one source domain, which is common in medical imaging applications. We tackle this problem in the context of cross-domain medical image segmentation. In this scenario, domain shifts are mainly caused by different acquisition processes. We propose a simple causality-inspired data augmentation approach to expose a segmentation model to synthesized domain-shifted training examples. Specifically, 1) to make the deep model robust to discrepancies in image intensities and textures, we employ a family of randomly-weighted shallow networks. They augment training images using diverse appearance transformations. 2) Further we show that spurious correlations among objects in an image are detrimental to domain robustness. These correlations might be taken by the network as domain-specific clues for making predictions, and they may break on unseen domains. We remove these spurious correlations via causal intervention. This is achieved by resampling the appearances of potentially correlated objects independently. The proposed approach is validated on three cross-domain segmentation scenarios: cross-modality (CT-MRI) abdominal image segmentation, cross-sequence (bSSFP-LGE) cardiac MRI segmentation, and cross-site prostate MRI segmentation. The proposed approach yields consistent performance gains compared with competitive methods when tested on unseen domains.",,,IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging,,,2022-11-23,2022,2022-11-23,2022-11-23,PP,99,1-1,All OA, Green,Article,"Ouyang, Cheng; Chen, Chen; Li, Surui; Li, Zeju; Qin, Chen; Bai, Wenjia; Rueckert, Daniel","Ouyang, Cheng (Department of Computing, Imperial College London, UK); Chen, Chen (Department of Computing, Imperial College London, UK); Li, Surui (Department of Computing, Imperial College London, UK); Li, Zeju (Department of Computing, Imperial College London, UK); Qin, Chen (Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London, UK); Bai, Wenjia (Department of Computing, Imperial College London, UK); Rueckert, Daniel (Department of Computing, Imperial College London, UK)",,"Ouyang, Cheng (Imperial College London); Chen, Chen (Imperial College London); Li, Surui (Imperial College London); Li, Zeju (Imperial College London); Qin, Chen (Imperial College London); Bai, Wenjia (Imperial College London); Rueckert, Daniel (Imperial College London)",5,5,,,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.12525,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1153013167,46 Information and Computing Sciences, 4611 Machine Learning,,,,,,,,,,
2210,pub.1153204132,10.1016/j.media.2022.102706,36516557,,Factorizer: A scalable interpretable approach to context modeling for medical image segmentation,"Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with U-shaped architectures have dominated medical image segmentation, which is crucial for various clinical purposes. However, the inherent locality of convolution makes CNNs fail to fully exploit global context, essential for better recognition of some structures, e.g., brain lesions. Transformers have recently proven promising performance on vision tasks, including semantic segmentation, mainly due to their capability of modeling long-range dependencies. Nevertheless, the quadratic complexity of attention makes existing Transformer-based models use self-attention layers only after somehow reducing the image resolution, which limits the ability to capture global contexts present at higher resolutions. Therefore, this work introduces a family of models, dubbed Factorizer, which leverages the power of low-rank matrix factorization for constructing an end-to-end segmentation model. Specifically, we propose a linearly scalable approach to context modeling, formulating Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) as a differentiable layer integrated into a U-shaped architecture. The shifted window technique is also utilized in combination with NMF to effectively aggregate local information. Factorizers compete favorably with CNNs and Transformers in terms of accuracy, scalability, and interpretability, achieving state-of-the-art results on the BraTS dataset for brain tumor segmentation and ISLES'22 dataset for stroke lesion segmentation. Highly meaningful NMF components give an additional interpretability advantage to Factorizers over CNNs and Transformers. Moreover, our ablation studies reveal a distinctive feature of Factorizers that enables a significant speed-up in inference for a trained Factorizer without any extra steps and without sacrificing much accuracy.

The first stage of a two-stage OMT (TSOMT) procedure transforms the brain into a unit solid ball. The second stage transforms the unit ball into a cube, as it is easier to apply a 3D convolutional neural network to rectangular coordinates. Small variations in the local mass-measure stretch ratio among all the brain tumor datasets confirm the robustness of the transform. Additionally, the distortion is kept at a minimum with a reasonable transport cost. The original 240×240×155×4\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

Three typical U-Nets are trained separately to predict the whole tumor (WT), tumor core (TC), and enhanced tumor (ET) from the cube. An impressive training accuracy of 0.9822 in the WT cube is achieved at 400 epochs. An inverse TSOMT method is applied to the predicted cube to obtain the brain results. The conversion loss from the TSOMT method to the inverse TSOMT method is found to be less than one percent. For training, good Dice scores (0.9781 for the WT, 0.9637 for the TC, and 0.9305 for the ET) can be obtained. Significant improvements in brain tumor detection and the segmentation accuracy are achieved. For testing, postprocessing (rotation) is added to the TSOMT, U-Net prediction, and inverse TSOMT methods for an accuracy improvement of one to two percent.

Traditionally, these tedious tasks were finished by experienced physicians or medical physicists and were marred with two major problems, low efficiency and bias. In the past decade, many machine learning methods have been applied to accelerate and automate the image analysis process. Compared to the enormous deployments of supervised and unsupervised learning models, attempts to use reinforcement learning in medical image analysis are still scarce. We hope that this review article could serve as the stepping stone for related research in the future.
SIGNIFICANCE: We found that although reinforcement learning has gradually gained momentum in recent years, many researchers in the medical analysis field still find it hard to understand and deploy in clinical settings. One possible cause is a lack of well-organized review articles intended for readers without professional computer science backgrounds. Rather than to provide a comprehensive list of all reinforcement learning models applied in medical image analysis, the aim of this review is to help the readers formulate and solve their medical image analysis research through the lens of reinforcement learning.
APPROACH & RESULTS: We selected published articles from Google Scholar and PubMed. Considering the scarcity of related articles, we also included some outstanding newest preprints. The papers were carefully reviewed and categorized according to the type of image analysis task. In this article, we first reviewed the basic concepts and popular models of reinforcement learning. Then, we explored the applications of reinforcement learning models in medical image analysis. Finally, we concluded the article by discussing the reviewed reinforcement learning approaches' limitations and possible future improvements.","This research is supported in part by the National Institutes of Health under Award Number R01CA215718, R56EB033332 and R01EB032680.",,Journal of Applied Clinical Medical Physics,,"Humans; Reproducibility of Results; Machine Learning; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted",2023-01-10,2023,2023-01-10,2023-02,24,2,e13898,All OA, Green,Article,"Hu, Mingzhe; Zhang, Jiahan; Matkovic, Luke; Liu, Tian; Yang, Xiaofeng","Hu, Mingzhe (Department of Radiation Oncology, School of Medicine, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia, USA; Department of Computer Science and Informatics, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia, USA); Zhang, Jiahan (Department of Radiation Oncology, School of Medicine, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia, USA); Matkovic, Luke (Department of Radiation Oncology, School of Medicine, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia, USA); Liu, Tian (Department of Radiation Oncology, School of Medicine, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia, USA); Yang, Xiaofeng (Department of Radiation Oncology, School of Medicine, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia, USA; Department of Computer Science and Informatics, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia, USA)","Yang, Xiaofeng (Emory University; Emory University)","Hu, Mingzhe (Emory University; Emory University); Zhang, Jiahan (Emory University); Matkovic, Luke (Emory University); Liu, Tian (Emory University); Yang, Xiaofeng (Emory University; Emory University)",0,0,,,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.14302,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1154363801,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences, 3208 Medical Physiology, 51 Physical Sciences, 5105 Medical and Biological Physics,,,,,,,,

2199,pub.1146338404,10.1016/j.cmpb.2022.106752,35338887,,H-ProSeg: Hybrid ultrasound prostate segmentation based on explainability-guided mathematical model,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Accurate and robust prostate segmentation in transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) images is of great interest for image-guided prostate interventions and prostate cancer diagnosis. However, it remains a challenging task for various reasons, including a missing or ambiguous boundary between the prostate and surrounding tissues, the presence of shadow artifacts, intra-prostate intensity heterogeneity, and anatomical variations.
METHODS: Here, we present a hybrid method for prostate segmentation (H-ProSeg) in TRUS images, using a small number of radiologist-defined seed points as the prior points. This method consists of three subnetworks. The first subnetwork uses an improved principal curve-based model to obtain data sequences consisting of seed points and their corresponding projection index. The second subnetwork uses an improved differential evolution-based artificial neural network for training to decrease the model error. The third subnetwork uses the parameters of the artificial neural network to explain the smooth mathematical description of the prostate contour. The performance of the H-ProSeg method was assessed in 55 brachytherapy patients using Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), Jaccard similarity coefficient (Ω), and accuracy (ACC) values.
RESULTS: The H-ProSeg method achieved excellent segmentation accuracy, with DSC, Ω, and ACC values of 95.8%, 94.3%, and 95.4%, respectively. Meanwhile, the DSC, Ω, and ACC values of the proposed method were as high as 93.3%, 91.9%, and 93%, respectively, due to the influence of Gaussian noise (standard deviation of Gaussian function, σ = 50). Although the σ increased from 10 to 50, the DSC, Ω, and ACC values fluctuated by a maximum of approximately 2.5%, demonstrating the excellent robustness of our method.
CONCLUSIONS: Here, we present a hybrid method for accurate and robust prostate ultrasound image segmentation. The H-ProSeg method achieved superior performance compared with current state-of-the-art techniques. The knowledge of precise boundaries of the prostate is crucial for the conservation of risk structures. The proposed models have the potential to improve prostate cancer diagnosis and therapeutic outcomes.","This work was partly supported by Innovation and Technology Fund Projects, Hong Kong, No. ITS/080/19.",,Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine,,"Brachytherapy; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Male; Models, Theoretical; Prostate; Prostatic Neoplasms; Ultrasonography",2022-03-17,2022,2022-03-17,2022-06,219,,106752,Closed,Article,"Peng, Tao; Wu, Yiyun; Qin, Jing; Wu, Qingrong Jackie; Cai, Jing","Peng, Tao (Department of Health Technology and Informatics, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China.); Wu, Yiyun (Department of Medical Technology, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China.); Qin, Jing (Department of Nursing, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China.); Wu, Qingrong Jackie (Department of Radiation Oncology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, USA.); Cai, Jing (Department of Health Technology and Informatics, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China.

In this paper, we present an automated, deep learning-based pipeline for accurate segmentation of tissues from neonatal brain MRI and extend it by introducing an age prediction pathway. A major constraint to using deep learning techniques on developing brain data is the need to collect large numbers of ground truth labels. We therefore also investigate two practical approaches that can help alleviate the problem of label scarcity without loss of segmentation performance. First, we examine the efficiency of different strategies of distributing a limited budget of annotated 2D slices over 3D training images. In the second approach, we compare the segmentation performance of pre-trained models with different strategies of fine-tuning on a small subset of preterm infants. Our results indicate that distributing labels over a larger number of brain scans can improve segmentation performance. We also show that even partial fine-tuning can be superior in performance to a model trained from scratch, highlighting the relevance of transfer learning strategies under conditions of label scarcity. We illustrate our findings on large, publicly available T1- and T2-weighted MRI scans (n = 709, range of ages at scan: 26-45 weeks) obtained retrospectively from the Developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP) cohort.","AF would like to thank the UK Research and Innovation Centre for Doctoral Training in Artificial Intelligence for Healthcare for supporting his research in his role as a Senior Teaching Fellow (Grant number EP/S023283/1).

2005,pub.1151185049,10.1016/j.media.2022.102628,36283200,,CrossMoDA 2021 challenge: Benchmark of cross-modality domain adaptation techniques for vestibular schwannoma and cochlea segmentation,"Domain Adaptation (DA) has recently been of strong interest in the medical imaging community. While a large variety of DA techniques have been proposed for image segmentation, most of these techniques have been validated either on private datasets or on small publicly available datasets. Moreover, these datasets mostly addressed single-class problems. To tackle these limitations, the Cross-Modality Domain Adaptation (crossMoDA) challenge was organised in conjunction with the 24th International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI 2021). CrossMoDA is the first large and multi-class benchmark for unsupervised cross-modality Domain Adaptation. The goal of the challenge is to segment two key brain structures involved in the follow-up and treatment planning of vestibular schwannoma (VS): the VS and the cochleas. Currently, the diagnosis and surveillance in patients with VS are commonly performed using contrast-enhanced T1 (ceT1) MR imaging. However, there is growing interest in using non-contrast imaging sequences such as high-resolution T2 (hrT2) imaging. For this reason, we established an unsupervised cross-modality segmentation benchmark. The training dataset provides annotated ceT1 scans (N=105) and unpaired non-annotated hrT2 scans (N=105). The aim was to automatically perform unilateral VS and bilateral cochlea segmentation on hrT2 scans as provided in the testing set (N=137). This problem is particularly challenging given the large intensity distribution gap across the modalities and the small volume of the structures. A total of 55 teams from 16 countries submitted predictions to the validation leaderboard. Among them, 16 teams from 9 different countries submitted their algorithm for the evaluation phase. The level of performance reached by the top-performing teams is strikingly high (best median Dice score - VS: 88.4%; Cochleas: 85.7%) and close to full supervision (median Dice score - VS: 92.5%; Cochleas: 87.7%). All top-performing methods made use of an image-to-image translation approach to transform the source-domain images into pseudo-target-domain images. A segmentation network was then trained using these generated images and the manual annotations provided for the source image.","We would like to thank all the other team members that helped during the challenge: Sewon Kim, Yohan Jun, Taejoon Eo, Dosik Hwang (Samoyed); Fei Yu, Jie Zhao, Bin Dong (PKU_BIALAB); Can Cui, Dingjie Su, Andrew Mcneil (MIP); Xi Yang, Kaizhu Huang, Jie Sun (PremiLab); Yingyu Yang, Aurelien Maillot, Marta Nunez-Garcia, Maxime Sermesant (Epione-Liryc); Dewei Hu, Qibang Zhu, Kathleen E Larson, Huahong Zhang (MedICL); Mingming Gong (DBMI_pitt); Ran Gu, Shuwei Zhai, Wenhui Lei (Hi-Lib); Richard Osuala, Carlos Martın-Isla, Victor M.

1945,pub.1132460023,10.1002/mp.14391,33169365,,Evaluation of multislice inputs to convolutional neural networks for medical image segmentation,"PURPOSE: When using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for segmentation of organs and lesions in medical images, the conventional approach is to work with inputs and outputs either as single slice [two-dimensional (2D)] or whole volumes [three-dimensional (3D)]. One common alternative, in this study denoted as pseudo-3D, is to use a stack of adjacent slices as input and produce a prediction for at least the central slice. This approach gives the network the possibility to capture 3D spatial information, with only a minor additional computational cost.
METHODS: In this study, we systematically evaluate the segmentation performance and computational costs of this pseudo-3D approach as a function of the number of input slices, and compare the results to conventional end-to-end 2D and 3D CNNs, and to triplanar orthogonal 2D CNNs. The standard pseudo-3D method regards the neighboring slices as multiple input image channels. We additionally design and evaluate a novel, simple approach where the input stack is a volumetric input that is repeatably convolved in 3D to obtain a 2D feature map. This 2D map is in turn fed into a standard 2D network. We conducted experiments using two different CNN backbone architectures and on eight diverse data sets covering different anatomical regions, imaging modalities, and segmentation tasks.
RESULTS: We found that while both pseudo-3D methods can process a large number of slices at once and still be computationally much more efficient than fully 3D CNNs, a significant improvement over a regular 2D CNN was only observed with two of the eight data sets. triplanar networks had the poorest performance of all the evaluated models. An analysis of the structural properties of the segmentation masks revealed no relations to the segmentation performance with respect to the number of input slices. A post hoc rank sum test which combined all metrics and data sets yielded that only our newly proposed pseudo-3D method with an input size of 13 slices outperformed almost all methods.
CONCLUSION: In the general case, multislice inputs appear not to improve segmentation results over using 2D or 3D CNNs. For the particular case of 13 input slices, the proposed novel pseudo-3D method does appear to have a slight advantage across all data sets compared to all other methods evaluated in this work.","The computations were performed on resources provided by the Swedish National Infrastructure for Computing (SNIC) at the HPC2N in Umeå, Sweden.

Following advancements in medicine and image processing, medical image segmentation methods are receiving a great deal of attention. As a novelty, the paper proposes an intelligent decision system for segmenting liver and hepatic tumors by integrating four efficient neural networks (ResNet152, ResNeXt101, DenseNet201, and InceptionV3). Images from computed tomography for training, validation, and testing were taken from the public LiTS17 database and preprocessed to better highlight liver tissue and tumors. Global segmentation is done by separately training individual classifiers and the global system of merging individual decisions. For the aforementioned application, classification neural networks have been modified for semantic segmentation. After segmentation based on the neural network system, the images were postprocessed to eliminate artifacts. The segmentation results obtained by the system were better, from the point of view of the Dice coefficient, than those obtained by the individual networks, and comparable with those reported in recent works.",,This research received no external funding.,Bioengineering,,,2022-09-13,2022,2022-09-13,,9,9,467,All OA, Gold,Article,"Popescu, Dan; Stanciulescu, Andrei; Pomohaci, Mihai Dan; Ichim, Loretta","Popescu, Dan (Faculty of Automatic Control and Computers, University POLITEHNICA of Bucharest, 060042 Bucharest, Romania.); Stanciulescu, Andrei (Faculty of Automatic Control and Computers, University POLITEHNICA of Bucharest, 060042 Bucharest, Romania.); Pomohaci, Mihai Dan (Faculty of Automatic Control and Computers, University POLITEHNICA of Bucharest, 060042 Bucharest, Romania.); Ichim, Loretta (Faculty of Automatic Control and Computers, University POLITEHNICA of Bucharest, 060042 Bucharest, Romania.)","Popescu, Dan (Polytechnic University of Bucharest)","Popescu, Dan (Polytechnic University of Bucharest); Stanciulescu, Andrei (Polytechnic University of Bucharest); Pomohaci, Mihai Dan (Polytechnic University of Bucharest); Ichim, Loretta (Polytechnic University of Bucharest)",0,0,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2306-5354/9/9/467/pdf?version=1663128665,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1151016560,40 Engineering, 4003 Biomedical Engineering,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, conventional biomarkers only moderately correlate with MS disease progression. Recently, some MS lesional imaging biomarkers such as cortical lesions (CL), the central vein sign (CVS), and paramagnetic rim lesions (PRL), visible in specialized magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences, have shown higher specificity in differential diagnosis. Moreover, studies have shown that CL and PRL are potential prognostic biomarkers, the former correlating with cognitive impairments and the latter with early disability progression. As machine learning-based methods have achieved extraordinary performance in the assessment of conventional imaging biomarkers, such as white matter lesion segmentation, several automated or semi-automated methods have been proposed as well for CL, PRL, and CVS. In the present review, we first introduce these MS biomarkers and their imaging methods. Subsequently, we describe the corresponding machine learning-based methods that were proposed to tackle these clinical questions, putting them into context with respect to the challenges they are facing, including non-standardized MRI protocols, limited datasets, and moderate inter-rater variability. We conclude by presenting the current limitations that prevent their broader deployment and suggesting future research directions.","F.L.R. is supported by the Swiss National Foundation (SNF) Postdoc Mobility Fellowship (P500PB_206833), the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie project TRABIT (agreement No 765148) and the Novartis Foundation for Medical-Biological Research (#21A032).

However, despite these advances, there are still problems for which DL-based segmentation fails. Recently, some DL approaches had a breakthrough by using anatomical information which is the crucial cue for manual segmentation. In this paper, we provide a review of anatomy-aided DL for medical image segmentation which covers systematically summarized anatomical information categories and corresponding representation methods. We address known and potentially solvable challenges in anatomy-aided DL and present a categorized methodology overview on using anatomical information with DL from over 70 papers. Finally, we discuss the strengths and limitations of the current anatomy-aided DL approaches and suggest potential future work.","The authors would like to thank the scientific advice provided by Prof R Vliegenthart from the Department of Radiology, University Medical Center Groningen.

A comparative review of key properties, current progresses, and future perspectives","Transformer, one of the latest technological advances of deep learning, has gained prevalence in natural language processing or computer vision. Since medical imaging bear some resemblance to computer vision, it is natural to inquire about the status quo of Transformers in medical imaging and ask the question: can the Transformer models transform medical imaging? In this paper, we attempt to make a response to the inquiry. After a brief introduction of the fundamentals of Transformers, especially in comparison with convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and highlighting key defining properties that characterize the Transformers, we offer a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art Transformer-based approaches for medical imaging and exhibit current research progresses made in the areas of medical image segmentation, recognition, detection, registration, reconstruction, enhancement, etc. In particular, what distinguishes our review lies in its organization based on the Transformer's key defining properties, which are mostly derived from comparing the Transformer and CNN, and its type of architecture, which specifies the manner in which the Transformer and CNN are combined, all helping the readers to best understand the rationale behind the reviewed approaches. We conclude with discussions of future perspectives.","Li and Zhou are supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) under grant No. 62271465.

1644,pub.1148221787,10.1016/j.media.2022.102488,35667327,,Robust deep learning-based semantic organ segmentation in hyperspectral images,"Semantic image segmentation is an important prerequisite for context-awareness and autonomous robotics in surgery. The state of the art has focused on conventional RGB video data acquired during minimally invasive surgery, but full-scene semantic segmentation based on spectral imaging data and obtained during open surgery has received almost no attention to date. To address this gap in the literature, we are investigating the following research questions based on hyperspectral imaging (HSI) data of pigs acquired in an open surgery setting: (1) What is an adequate representation of HSI data for neural network-based fully automated organ segmentation, especially with respect to the spatial granularity of the data (pixels vs. superpixels vs. patches vs. full images)? (2) Is there a benefit of using HSI data compared to other modalities, namely RGB data and processed HSI data (e.g. tissue parameters like oxygenation), when performing semantic organ segmentation? According to a comprehensive validation study based on 506 HSI images from 20 pigs, annotated with a total of 19 classes, deep learning-based segmentation performance increases - consistently across modalities - with the spatial context of the input data. Unprocessed HSI data offers an advantage over RGB data or processed data from the camera provider, with the advantage increasing with decreasing size of the input to the neural network. Maximum performance (HSI applied to whole images) yielded a mean DSC of 0.90 ((standard deviation (SD)) 0.04), which is in the range of the inter-rater variability (DSC of 0.89 ((standard deviation (SD)) 0.07)). We conclude that HSI could become a powerful image modality for fully-automatic surgical scene understanding with many advantages over traditional imaging, including the ability to recover additional functional tissue information.

Hence, a non-invasive assessment of tumor grade is of paramount importance to choose the best treatment plan. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) represent one of the effective Deep Learning (DL)-based techniques that have been used for brain tumor diagnosis. However, they are unable to handle input modifications effectively. Capsule neural networks (CapsNets) are a novel type of machine learning (ML) architecture that was recently developed to address the drawbacks of CNNs. CapsNets are resistant to rotations and affine translations, which is beneficial when processing medical imaging datasets. Moreover, Vision Transformers (ViT)-based solutions have been very recently proposed to address the issue of long-range dependency in CNNs. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of brain tumor classification and segmentation techniques, with a focus on ML-based, CNN-based, CapsNet-based, and ViT-based techniques. The survey highlights the fundamental contributions of recent studies and the performance of state-of-the-art techniques.

progress in the field of semantic segmentation for the medical image computing
community. However, developed algorithms are often optimized and validated by
hand based on one task only. In combination with small datasets, interpreting
the generalizability of the results is often difficult. The Medical
Segmentation Decathlon challenge addresses this problem, and aims to facilitate
development of generalizable 3D semantic segmentation algorithms that require
no manual parametrization. Such an algorithm was developed and is presented in
this paper. It consists of a 3D convolutional neural network with
encoder-decoder architecture employing residual-connections, skip-connections
and multi-level generation of predictions. It works on anisotropic
voxel-geometries and has anisotropic depth, i.e., the number of downsampling
steps is a task-specific parameter. These depths are automatically inferred for
each task prior to training. By combining this flexible architecture with
on-the-fly data augmentation and little-to-no pre-- or postprocessing,
promising results could be achieved. The code developed for this challenge will

on their robustness against adversarial perturbations to the input data.
Several attacks and defenses have been proposed to improve the performance of
Deep Neural Networks under the presence of adversarial noise in the natural
image domain. However, robustness in computer-aided diagnosis for volumetric
data has only been explored for specific tasks and with limited attacks. We
propose a new framework to assess the robustness of general medical image
segmentation systems. Our contributions are two-fold: (i) we propose a new
benchmark to evaluate robustness in the context of the Medical Segmentation
Decathlon (MSD) by extending the recent AutoAttack natural image classification
framework to the domain of volumetric data segmentation, and (ii) we present a
novel lattice architecture for RObust Generic medical image segmentation (ROG).

1220,pub.1152214753,10.48550/arxiv.2210.14677,,,How precise are performance estimates for typical medical image  segmentation tasks?,"An important issue in medical image processing is to be able to estimate not
only the performances of algorithms but also the precision of the estimation of
these performances. Reporting precision typically amounts to reporting
standard-error of the mean (SEM) or equivalently confidence intervals. However,
this is rarely done in medical image segmentation studies. In this paper, we
aim to estimate what is the typical confidence that can be expected in such
studies. To that end, we first perform experiments for Dice metric estimation
using a standard deep learning model (U-net) and a classical task from the
Medical Segmentation Decathlon. We extensively study precision estimation using
both Gaussian assumption and bootstrapping (which does not require any
assumption on the distribution). We then perform simulations for other test set
sizes and performance spreads. Overall, our work shows that small test sets
lead to wide confidence intervals (e.g. $\sim$8 points of Dice for 20 samples
with $\sigma \simeq 10$).",,,arXiv,,,2022-10-26,2022,,,,,,All OA, Green,Preprint,"Jurdi, Rosana El; Colliot, Olivier","Jurdi, Rosana El (); Colliot, Olivier ()",,"Jurdi, Rosana El (); Colliot, Olivier ()",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1152214753,46 Information and Computing Sciences, 4603 Computer Vision and Multimedia Computation,,,,,,,,,,

Correct image segmentation can help healthcare professionals to have better arguments to define a diagnosis and a possible treatment. Among the existing methods and techniques for this task is the TransUNet architecture. This architecture comes from the U-Net architecture, its predecessor, and has the characteristic of incorporating transformers in its encoder. This paper analyzes TransUNet and contrasts its performance with its predecessor. For this purpose, the architectures were implemented, trained, and tested using the Medical Segmentation Decathlon dataset, which provides new challenges and tasks different from those usually addressed. The experimental results reveal the superiority of TransUNet over U-Net in both spleen and left atrium segmentation by reducing the loss in 83% and 72% in the training and testing set, respectively, in the spleen task; and 94% and 92% in the left atrium task. Likewise, in the dice score, TransUNet achieved a superiority of 3.42% and 0.34% for the spleen and left atrium task, respectively, over U-Net.",The authors are grateful for the valuable support given by the SDAS Research Group (www.sdas-group.com - Last accessed: 07 - Jun - 2022).,,Communications in Computer and Information Science,Applied Technologies,,2023-01-28,2023,2023-01-28,2023,1755,,212-226,Closed,Chapter,"Castro, Roberto; Ramos, Leo; Román, Stadyn; Bermeo, Mike; Crespo, Anthony; Cuenca, Erick","Castro, Roberto (Yachay Tech University, Urcuquí, Ecuador); Ramos, Leo (Yachay Tech University, Urcuquí, Ecuador); Román, Stadyn (Yachay Tech University, Urcuquí, Ecuador); Bermeo, Mike (Yachay Tech University, Urcuquí, Ecuador); Crespo, Anthony (Yachay Tech University, Urcuquí, Ecuador); Cuenca, Erick (Yachay Tech University, Urcuquí, Ecuador)","Castro, Roberto (Universidad Yachay Tech)","Castro, Roberto (Universidad Yachay Tech); Ramos, Leo (Universidad Yachay Tech); Román, Stadyn (Universidad Yachay Tech); Bermeo, Mike (Universidad Yachay Tech); Crespo, Anthony (Universidad Yachay Tech); Cuenca, Erick (Universidad Yachay Tech)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1154910303,46 Information and Computing Sciences, 4605 Data Management and Data Science,,,,,,,,,,,

many biomedical image segmentation tasks due to a better global information
modeling from the self-attention mechanism. However, most methods are still

is the quadratic complexity introduced by the self-attention mechanism

architecture for 3D medical image segmentation using an encoder-decoder style
architecture with linear complexity. Furthermore, we newly introduce a dynamic
token concept to further reduce the token numbers for self-attention
calculation. Taking advantage of the global information modeling, we provide
uncertainty maps from different hierarchy stages. We evaluate this method on
multiple challenging CT pancreas segmentation datasets. Our promising results
show that our novel 3D Transformer-based segmentor could provide promising
highly feasible segmentation performance and accurate uncertainty

State-of-the-art seminal segmentation methods (including hippocampus segmentation) are based on deep learning algorithms. Most studies focused on developing robust deep learning algorithms to achieve satisfactory performance in hippocampus body and head segmentation. A critical aspect that has been overlooked in these studies is the strategy adopted to train deep learning algorithms when there are two or more target structures. In this work, we examine which deep learning training strategies would be more effective. These strategies include simultaneous (parallel segmentation of the head and body), serial (first head and then body), independent, and attention-based training and segmentation of the target structures. To this end, the hippocampus dataset from the Decathlon challenge and a residual neural network (Resnet) were employed to compare the above-mentioned strategies for hippocampus head and body segmentation. The Dice similarity coefficient and Hausdorff distance were calculated for the outcome of each strategy versus the manually defined hippocampus head and body masks. The quantitative analysis of the outcomes of different training frameworks demonstrated the superior performance of the attention-based training framework with Dice index of 0.89±0.03 (body) and 0.88±0.04 (head) compared to simultaneous, serial, and independent training frameworks with Dice indices of 0.88±0.04 (body) and 0.87±0.04 (head), 0.88±0.04 (body) and 0.87±0.04 (head), and 0.88±0.04 (body) and 0.86±0.04 (head), respectively.

With medical imaging, the organs’ functions are analyzed, and anomalies are detected effectively. The imaging process utilizes enhancement, analysis, and recognition procedures that maximize disease detection accuracy. However, the gathered medical images have noise while performing the medical research that affects the ROI region segmentation process. The improper identification of the ROI region causes to reduce disease detection accuracy and create complexity. Therefore, this paper uses the Adam optimization technique with deep learning approaches for examining the medical images. The deep learning (DL) approaches utilizing the multiple layers, expert-tuned parameters, and learning function to deriving the affected ROT region. The DL method automatically extracts the medical imaging features that are optimized according to the RMS prop and momentum-based learning parameters. The optimized parameter minimizes the complexity while deriving the disease affected region. This process ensures high region segmentation accuracy with minimum time. The process has detected the affected region with 99.27% of accuracy.",,,Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems,Proceedings of International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Intelligent Systems,,2021-12-03,2021,2021-12-03,2022,322,,669-691,Closed,Chapter,"Jaber, Mustafa Musa; Abd, Sura Khalil; Ali, Saif Mohammed","Jaber, Mustafa Musa (Information Technology Department, Dijlah University College, Baghdad, Iraq; Al-Turath University College, Baghdad, Iraq); Abd, Sura Khalil (Computer Techniques Engineering, Dijlah University College, Baghdad, Iraq); Ali, Saif Mohammed (Computer Science Department, Dijlah University College, Baghdad, Iraq)","Jaber, Mustafa Musa (Dijlah University College; Al Turath University College)","Jaber, Mustafa Musa (Dijlah University College; Al Turath University College); Abd, Sura Khalil (Dijlah University College); Ali, Saif Mohammed (Dijlah University College)",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1143572755,46 Information and Computing Sciences, 4605 Data Management and Data Science,,,,,,,,,,,

However, conventional computer-aided annotation methods have difficulty annotating cases with weakly visible hepatic vascular structures. To address this issue, we proposed a class center attention convolutional neural network with spatial adaption. In our method, an improved 2.5D input module—one with spatial adaption—was used to enhance difficult to observe information on the target slices. Furthermore, a class center attention branch was introduced, which refines the unclear boundaries caused by the low-visibility hepatic vascular system by detecting the consistency of the class centers and the voxels near boundaries. Our proposed framework is trained and evaluated on 112 CT scans which were produced by the Task08_HepaticVessel in the Medical segmentation Decathlon study. Experimental results demonstrate the final algorithm for classification of hepatic segments obtained large overlaps comparable to that of manual annotations, even if the visibility of the hepatic vascular system is low.","This work was supported by the Shenzhen Science and Technology Program of China grant JCYJ20200109115420720; National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 61901463, No. 51877015 and U20A20373); Guangdong province key research and development areas grant 2020B1111140001.",,Displays,,,2022-04,2022,,2022-04,72,,102151,Closed,Article,"Tian, Yinli; Sun, Peiwei; Xue, Fei; Lambo, Ricardo; Yue, Meiyan; An, Chao; Diao, Songhui; Lv, Jianping; Xie, Yaoqin; Gong, Peng; Cao, Hailin; Qin, Wenjian","Tian, Yinli (Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen 518055, China; School of Microelectronics and Communication Engineering, Chongqing University, Chongqing 400044, China); Sun, Peiwei (Department of General Surgery, Shenzhen University General Hospital, Shenzhen 518055, China); Xue, Fei (Osaka University, 1-1 Yamadaoka, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan); Lambo, Ricardo (Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen 518055, China); Yue, Meiyan (Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen 518055, China); An, Chao (Department of Minimal Invasive Intervention, Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou 510060, China); Diao, Songhui (Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen 518055, China); Lv, Jianping (Department of Neurosurgery, Guangzhou First People's Hospital, School of Medicine, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510180, China); Xie, Yaoqin (Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen 518055, China); Gong, Peng (Department of General Surgery, Shenzhen University General Hospital, Shenzhen 518055, China); Cao, Hailin (School of Microelectronics and Communication Engineering, Chongqing University, Chongqing 400044, China); Qin, Wenjian (Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen 518055, China)","Qin, Wenjian (Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology)","Tian, Yinli (Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology; Chongqing University); Sun, Peiwei (Shenzhen University); Xue, Fei (Osaka University); Lambo, Ricardo (Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology); Yue, Meiyan (Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology); An, Chao (Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center); Diao, Songhui (Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology); Lv, Jianping (); Xie, Yaoqin (Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology); Gong, Peng (Shenzhen University); Cao, Hailin (Chongqing University); Qin, Wenjian (Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1144939658,46 Information and Computing Sciences, 4611 Machine Learning,,,,,,,,,,,

outstanding modeling capabilities, in particular for capturing long-range
information, and scalability to dataset and model sizes which has led to
state-of-the-art performance in various computer vision and medical image
analysis tasks. In this work, we introduce a unified framework consisting of
two architectures, dubbed UNetFormer, with a 3D Swin Transformer-based encoder
and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and transformer-based decoders. In the
proposed model, the encoder is linked to the decoder via skip connections at
five different resolutions with deep supervision. The design of proposed
architecture allows for meeting a wide range of trade-off requirements between
accuracy and computational cost. In addition, we present a methodology for
self-supervised pre-training of the encoder backbone via learning to predict
randomly masked volumetric tokens using contextual information of visible
tokens. We pre-train our framework on a cohort of $5050$ CT images, gathered
from publicly available CT datasets, and present a systematic investigation of
various components such as masking ratio and patch size that affect the
representation learning capability and performance of downstream tasks. We
validate the effectiveness of our pre-training approach by fine-tuning and
testing our model on liver and liver tumor segmentation task using the Medical
Segmentation Decathlon (MSD) dataset and achieve state-of-the-art performance
in terms of various segmentation metrics. To demonstrate its generalizability,
we train and test the model on BraTS 21 dataset for brain tumor segmentation
using MRI images and outperform other methods in terms of Dice score. Code:

1120,pub.1155807811,,,,Frequency Disentangled Learning for Segmentation of Midbrain Structures  from Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping Data,"One often lacks sufficient annotated samples for training deep segmentation
models. This is in particular the case for less common imaging modalities such
as Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping (QSM). It has been shown that deep
models tend to fit the target function from low to high frequencies. One may
hypothesize that such property can be leveraged for better training of deep
learning models. In this paper, we exploit this property to propose a new
training method based on frequency-domain disentanglement. It consists of two
main steps: i) disentangling the image into high- and low-frequency parts and
feature learning; ii) frequency-domain fusion to complete the task. The
approach can be used with any backbone segmentation network. We apply the
approach to the segmentation of the red and dentate nuclei from QSM data which
is particularly relevant for the study of parkinsonian syndromes. We
demonstrate that the proposed method provides considerable performance
improvements for these tasks. We further applied it to three public datasets
from the Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD) challenge. For two MSD tasks, it
provided smaller but still substantial improvements (up to 7 points of Dice),

1119,pub.1155376301,,,,Detection and Segmentation of Pancreas using Morphological Snakes and  Deep Convolutional Neural Networks,"Pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest types of cancer, with 25% of the
diagnosed patients surviving for only one year and 6% of them for five.
Computed tomography (CT) screening trials have played a key role in improving
early detection of pancreatic cancer, which has shown significant improvement
in patient survival rates. However, advanced analysis of such images often
requires manual segmentation of the pancreas, which is a time-consuming task.
Moreover, pancreas presents high variability in shape, while occupying only a
very small area of the entire abdominal CT scans, which increases the
complexity of the problem. The rapid development of deep learning can
contribute to offering robust algorithms that provide inexpensive, accurate,
and user-independent segmentation results that can guide the domain experts.
This dissertation addresses this task by investigating a two-step approach for
pancreas segmentation, by assisting the task with a prior rough localization or
detection of pancreas. This rough localization of the pancreas is provided by
an estimated probability map and the detection task is achieved by using the
YOLOv4 deep learning algorithm. The segmentation task is tackled by a modified
U-Net model applied on cropped data, as well as by using a morphological active
contours algorithm. For comparison, the U-Net model was also applied on the
full CT images, which provide a coarse pancreas segmentation to serve as
reference. Experimental results of the detection network on the National
Institutes of Health (NIH) dataset and the pancreas tumour task dataset within
the Medical Segmentation Decathlon show 50.67% mean Average Precision. The best
segmentation network achieved good segmentation results on the NIH dataset,

1085,pub.1138796801,10.48550/arxiv.2106.05735,,,The Medical Segmentation Decathlon,"International challenges have become the de facto standard for comparative
assessment of image analysis algorithms given a specific task. Segmentation is
so far the most widely investigated medical image processing task, but the
various segmentation challenges have typically been organized in isolation,
such that algorithm development was driven by the need to tackle a single
specific clinical problem. We hypothesized that a method capable of performing
well on multiple tasks will generalize well to a previously unseen task and
potentially outperform a custom-designed solution. To investigate the
hypothesis, we organized the Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD) - a
biomedical image analysis challenge, in which algorithms compete in a multitude
of both tasks and modalities. The underlying data set was designed to explore
the axis of difficulties typically encountered when dealing with medical
images, such as small data sets, unbalanced labels, multi-site data and small
objects. The MSD challenge confirmed that algorithms with a consistent good
performance on a set of tasks preserved their good average performance on a
different set of previously unseen tasks. Moreover, by monitoring the MSD
winner for two years, we found that this algorithm continued generalizing well
to a wide range of other clinical problems, further confirming our hypothesis.
Three main conclusions can be drawn from this study: (1) state-of-the-art image
segmentation algorithms are mature, accurate, and generalize well when
retrained on unseen tasks; (2) consistent algorithmic performance across
multiple tasks is a strong surrogate of algorithmic generalizability; (3) the
training of accurate AI segmentation models is now commoditized to non AI
experts.",,,arXiv,,,2021-06-10,2021,,,,,,All OA, Green,Preprint,"Antonelli, Michela; Reinke, Annika; Bakas, Spyridon; Farahani, Keyvan; AnnetteKopp-Schneider; Landman, Bennett A.; Litjens, Geert; Menze, Bjoern; Ronneberger, Olaf; Summers, Ronald M.; van Ginneken, Bram; Bilello, Michel; Bilic, Patrick; Christ, Patrick F.; Do, Richard K.

interest. However, there is a potentially impactful issue within NAS that
remains largely unrecognized: noise. Due to stochastic factors in neural
network initialization, training, and the chosen train/validation dataset
split, the performance evaluation of a neural network architecture, which is
often based on a single learning run, is also stochastic. This may have a
particularly large impact if a dataset is small. We therefore propose to reduce
this noise by evaluating architectures based on average performance over
multiple network training runs using different random seeds and
cross-validation. We perform experiments for a combinatorial optimization
formulation of NAS in which we vary noise reduction levels. We use the same
computational budget for each noise level in terms of network training runs,
i.e., we allow less architecture evaluations when averaging over more training
runs. Multiple search algorithms are considered, including evolutionary
algorithms which generally perform well for NAS. We use two publicly available
datasets from the medical image segmentation domain where datasets are often
limited and variability among samples is often high. Our results show that
reducing noise in architecture evaluations enables finding better architectures

Because manual brain tumour segmentation is a time-consuming, costly, and subjective task, effective automated approaches for this purpose are generally desired. However, because brain tumours vary greatly in terms of location, shape, and size, establishing automatic segmentation algorithms has remained challenging throughout the years. Automatic segmentation of brain tumour is the process of separating abnormal tissues from normal tissues, such as white matter (WM), gray matter (GM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Brian segmentation needs typically to be carried out for different image modalities in order to reveal important metabolic and physiological information. These modalities include positron emission tomography (PET), computer tomography (CT) image and magnetic resonance image (MRI). Multimodal imaging techniques (such as PET/CT and PET/MRI) that combine the information from multiple imaging modalities contribute more for accurate brain tumour segmentation. In this work, we introduce a deep learning framework for automated segmentation of 3D brain tumors that can save physicians time and provide an accurate reproducible solution for further tumor analysis and monitoring. In particular, a 3D U-Net was trained on brain MRI data obtained from the 2018 Brain tumor Image Segmentation (BraTS) challenge. Three optimizers (RMSProp, Adam and Nadam) and three loss functions (Dice loss, focal Tversky loss, Log-Cosh loss functions) were used. We demonstrated that some loss functions and optimizers combinations perform better than other ones. For example, using the Log-Cosh loss function along with RMSProp optimizer resulted in the highest Dice coefficient, 0.75. Indeed, we also optimized the network hyperparameters in order to enhance the segmentation outcomes. These results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed deep learning scheme with optimized hyperparemeters and appropriate selection of the optimizer and loss function.",,,,2021 3rd Novel Intelligent and Leading Emerging Sciences Conference (NILES),,2021-10-25,2021,,2021-10-25,0,,269-272,Closed,Proceeding,"Gamal, Ali; Bedda, Khaled; Ashraf, Nada; Ayman, Salma; AbdAllah, Mohamed; Rushdi, Muhammad A.","Gamal, Ali (Department of Biomedical Engineering and Systems Faculty of Engineering, Cairo University); Bedda, Khaled (Department of Biomedical Engineering and Systems Faculty of Engineering, Cairo University); Ashraf, Nada (Department of Biomedical Engineering and Systems Faculty of Engineering, Cairo University); Ayman, Salma (Department of Biomedical Engineering and Systems Faculty of Engineering, Cairo University); AbdAllah, Mohamed (Department of Biomedical Engineering and Systems Faculty of Engineering, Cairo University); Rushdi, Muhammad A.

global spatial cues, and preserving information along all axes of the volume.
Encoder of the proposed design benefits from self-attention mechanism to
simultaneously encode local and global cues, while the decoder employs a
parallel self and cross attention formulation to capture fine details for
boundary refinement. Empirically, we show that the proposed design choices
result in a computationally efficient model, with competitive and promising
results on the Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD) brain tumor segmentation
(BraTS) Task. We further show that the representations learned by our model are
robust against data corruptions.

The uses of the General Adversarial Network (GAN) in the automatic segmentation of abdominal pictures are discussed in this review article. Discussion in this paper starts off by reviewing the underlying theory of GAN and its variations, then covering the most recent abdominal segmentation techniques. In addition, it introduces the variety of applications and datasets included for these imaging studies.

Such snakes models are ideal choices for handling medical image segmentation problems since they are very efficient and require fewer memories by solely tracking the explicit curves or surfaces. However, traditional snakes models solved by the level set method suffer from numerical instabilities and are usually difficult to deal with topological changes. In this paper, we propose a learned snakes model for 3D medical image segmentation, where both the initial and final surfaces are estimated using deep neural networks in end-to-end regimes. The merit of our learned snakes model is that we can realize 3D segmentation by finding a 2D surface based on 2D convolutional neural networks rather than using 3D networks or cutting the volume into 2D slices. Experiments on the Medical Segmentation Decathlon spleen dataset against both 2D- and 3D-based networks demonstrate our model achieving the state-of-the-art accuracy and efficiency, which not only enjoys a 1% higher DSC but also saves more than 90% computational time compared to the well-established elastic boundary projection model Ni et al.

In clinical practice, the source data usually cannot be accessed during adaptation for privacy policy and the label for the target domain is in shortage because of the high cost of professional labeling. Therefore, it is worth considering how to efficiently adopt a pretrained model with only unlabeled data from the target domain. In this paper, we propose a novel fully test-time unsupervised adaptation method for image segmentation based on Regional Nuclear-norm (RN) and Contour Regularization (CR). The RN loss is specially designed for segmentation tasks to efficiently improve discriminability and diversity of prediction. The CR loss constrains the continuity and connectivity to enhance the relevance between pixels and their neighbors. Instead of retraining all parameters, we modify only the parameters in batch normalization layers with only a few epochs.

This is in part because large training databases do not exist and in part because biomedical an-notations are often noisy. In this paper, we show that by introducing templates within the deep learning pipeline we can overcome these problems. The proposed framework, named ImplicitAtlas, represents a shape as a deformation field from a learned template field, where multiple templates could be integrated to improve the shape representation ca-pacity at negligible computational cost. Extensive experi-ments on three medical shape datasets prove the superiority over current implicit representation methods.","This work was supported by National Science Foundation of China (U20B2072, 61976137).

Un-labeled data, on the other hand, is much more abundant. Semi-supervised learning techniques, such as co-training, could provide a powerful tool to leverage unlabeled data. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, uncertainty-aware multi-view co-training (UMCT), to address semi-supervised learning on 3D data, such as volumetric data from medical imaging. In our work, co-training is achieved by exploiting multi-viewpoint consistency of 3D data. We generate different views by rotating or permuting the 3D data and utilize asymmetrical 3D kernels to encourage diversified features in different sub-networks. In addition, we propose an uncertainty-weighted label fusion mechanism to estimate the reliability of each view’s prediction with Bayesian deep learning. As one view requires the supervision from other views in co-training, our self-adaptive approach computes a confidence score for the prediction of each unlabeled sample in order to assign a reliable pseudo label. Thus, our approach can take advantage of unlabeled data during training. We show the effectiveness of our proposed semi-supervised method on several public datasets from medical image segmentation tasks (NIH pancreas & LiTS liver tumor dataset). Meanwhile, a fully-supervised method based on our approach achieved state-of-the-art performances on both the LiTS liver tumor segmentation and the Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD) challenge, demonstrating the robustness and value of our framework, even when fully supervised training is feasible.","We thank Dr. Lingxi Xie, Siyuan Qiao and Yuyin Zhou for instructive discussions.",,,2020 IEEE Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV),,2020-03-05,2020,,2020-03-05,0,,3635-3644,All OA, Green,Proceeding,"Xia, Yingda; Liu, Fengze; Yang, Dong; Cai, Jinzheng; Yu, Lequan; Zhu, Zhuotun; Xu, Daguang; Yuille, Alan; Roth, Holger","Xia, Yingda (Johns Hopkins University); Liu, Fengze (Johns Hopkins University); Yang, Dong (NVIDIA); Cai, Jinzheng (University of Florida); Yu, Lequan (The Chinese University of Hong Kong); Zhu, Zhuotun (Johns Hopkins University); Xu, Daguang (NVIDIA); Yuille, Alan (Johns Hopkins University); Roth, Holger (NVIDIA)","Xia, Yingda (Johns Hopkins University)","Xia, Yingda (Johns Hopkins University); Liu, Fengze (Johns Hopkins University); Yang, Dong (Nvidia (United States)); Cai, Jinzheng (University of Florida); Yu, Lequan (Chinese University of Hong Kong); Zhu, Zhuotun (Johns Hopkins University); Xu, Daguang (Nvidia (United States)); Yuille, Alan (Johns Hopkins University); Roth, Holger (Nvidia (United States))",74,60,,34.59,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.12506,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1127622974,46 Information and Computing Sciences, 4605 Data Management and Data Science, 4611 Machine Learning,,,,,,,,,

Automatic segmentation of medical images is a key step for diagnostic and interventional tasks. However, achieving this requires large amounts of annotated volumes, which can be tedious and time-consuming task for expert annotators. In this paper, we introduce DeepEdit, a deep learning-based method for volumetric medical image annotation, that allows automatic and semi-automatic segmentation, and click-based refinement. DeepEdit combines the power of two methods: a non-interactive (i.e. automatic segmentation using nnU-Net, UNET or UNETR) and an interactive segmentation method (i.e. DeepGrow), into a single deep learning model. It allows easy integration of uncertainty-based ranking strategies (i.e. aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty computation) and active learning. We propose and implement a method for training DeepEdit by using standard training combined with user interaction simulation. Once trained, DeepEdit allows clinicians to quickly segment their datasets by using the algorithm in auto segmentation mode or by providing clicks via a user interface (i.e. 3D Slicer, OHIF). We show the value of DeepEdit through evaluation on the PROSTATEx dataset for prostate/prostatic lesions and the Multi-Atlas Labeling Beyond the Cranial Vault (BTCV) dataset for abdominal CT segmentation, using state-of-the-art network architectures as baseline for comparison. DeepEdit could reduce the time and effort annotating 3D medical images compared to DeepGrow alone.

liver images is an active field of research, but suffers from some critical
limitations. First, they are heavily reliant on labeled data, which can be
challenging and costly to acquire. Second, they lack transparency and
explainability, which limits the trustworthiness of deep CBIR systems. We
address these limitations by (1) proposing a self-supervised learning framework
that incorporates domain-knowledge into the training procedure and (2)
providing the first representation learning explainability analysis in the
context of CBIR of CT liver images. Results demonstrate improved performance
compared to the standard self-supervised approach across several metrics, as
well as improved generalisation across datasets. Further, we conduct the first
representation learning explainability analysis in the context of CBIR, which
reveals new insights into the feature extraction process. Lastly, we perform a
case study with cross-examination CBIR that demonstrates the usability of our
proposed framework. We believe that our proposed framework could play a vital

Abdominal organ segmentation is an essential and time-consuming task in clinical radiology. The possibility to implement a semi-automatic segmentation system could speed up the time required to label the images and to improve the delineation results, minimizing both intra- and inter-operator variability.The proposed region growing algorithm exploits an initial seed point to perform the first slice-wise segmentation. Then, starting from this area, all other seeds are automatically discovered taking advantage of two data structures that we called Moving Average Seed Heatmap (MASH) and Area Union Map (AUM). The implemented mechanism avoids the choice of unsuitable seeds and the exclusion of irrelevant organs and tissues from the CT scan.We assessed the validity of the proposed liver and spleen segmentation method on two publicly available datasets: SLIVER07 and Medical Segmentation Decathlon Task 09 (MSD 09), respectively.The proposed method allowed us to obtain promising results for both liver and spleen segmentation, with a Dice Coefficient higher than 93% for the liver segmentation task and a Dice Coefficient greater than 92% for the spleen segmentation task on the designated validation sets.",,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science,Intelligent Computing Theories and Application,,2020-10-05,2020,2020-10-05,2020,12463,,398-410,Closed,Chapter,"Prencipe, Berardino; Altini, Nicola; Cascarano, Giacomo Donato; Guerriero, Andrea; Brunetti, Antonio","Prencipe, Berardino (Polytechnic University of Bari, 70126, Bari, Italy); Altini, Nicola (Polytechnic University of Bari, 70126, Bari, Italy); Cascarano, Giacomo Donato (Polytechnic University of Bari, 70126, Bari, Italy; Apulian Bioengineering srl, Via delle Violette 14, 70026, Modugno, BA, Italy); Guerriero, Andrea (Polytechnic University of Bari, 70126, Bari, Italy); Brunetti, Antonio (Polytechnic University of Bari, 70126, Bari, Italy; Apulian Bioengineering srl, Via delle Violette 14, 70026, Modugno, BA, Italy)","Brunetti, Antonio (Polytechnic University of Bari; )","Prencipe, Berardino (Polytechnic University of Bari); Altini, Nicola (Polytechnic University of Bari); Cascarano, Giacomo Donato (Polytechnic University of Bari); Guerriero, Andrea (Polytechnic University of Bari); Brunetti, Antonio (Polytechnic University of Bari)",5,5,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1131662241,46 Information and Computing Sciences,,,,,,,,,,,,

This trend has culminated in the framework nnU-Net, which adapts preprocessing, training and inference to the respective dataset and thus managed to lead the Medical Segmentation Decathlon challenge despite relying on comparably simple models. In this paper, we focus on one ancillary technique that is commonly used but poorly addressed in literature: patchwise training. Since computational costs tend to increase drastically when using naive strategies, we discuss the benefits of content-sensitive sampling for patchwise training of deep learning segmentation models.

950,pub.1137337991,10.48550/arxiv.2104.08717,,,The hidden label-marginal biases of segmentation losses,"Most segmentation losses are arguably variants of the Cross-Entropy (CE) or
Dice losses. In the abundant segmentation literature, there is no clear
consensus as to which of these losses is a better choice, with varying
performances for each across different benchmarks and applications. In this
work, we develop a theoretical analysis that links these two types of losses,
exposing their advantages and weaknesses. First, we provide a
constrained-optimization perspective showing that CE and Dice share a much
deeper connection than previously thought: They both decompose into
label-marginal penalties and closely related ground-truth matching penalties.
Then, we provide bound relationships and an information-theoretic analysis,
which uncover hidden label-marginal biases: Dice has an intrinsic bias towards
specific extremely imbalanced solutions, whereas CE implicitly encourages the
ground-truth region proportions. Our theoretical results explain the wide
experimental evidence in the medical-imaging literature, whereby Dice losses
bring improvements for imbalanced segmentation. It also explains why CE
dominates natural-image problems with diverse class proportions, in which case
Dice might have difficulty adapting to different label-marginal distributions.
Based on our theoretical analysis, we propose a principled and simple solution,
which enables to control explicitly the label-marginal bias. Our loss
integrates CE with explicit ${\cal L}_1$ regularization, which encourages label
marginals to match target class proportions, thereby mitigating class imbalance
but without losing generality. Comprehensive experiments and ablation studies
over different losses and applications validate our theoretical analysis, as
well as the effectiveness of our explicit label-marginal regularizers.",,,arXiv,,,2021-04-18,2021,,,,,,All OA, Green,Preprint,"Liu, Bingyuan; Dolz, Jose; Galdran, Adrian; Kobbi, Riadh; Ayed, Ismail Ben","Liu, Bingyuan (); Dolz, Jose (); Galdran, Adrian (); Kobbi, Riadh (); Ayed, Ismail Ben ()",,"Liu, Bingyuan (); Dolz, Jose (); Galdran, Adrian (); Kobbi, Riadh (); Ayed, Ismail Ben ()",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1137337991,46 Information and Computing Sciences, 4603 Computer Vision and Multimedia Computation,,,,,,,,,,

Unlabeled data, on the other hand, is much easier to acquire. Semi-supervised

propose uncertainty-aware multi-view co-training (UMCT), a unified framework

framework is capable of efficiently utilizing unlabeled data for better
performance. We firstly rotate and permute the 3D volumes into multiple views
and train a 3D deep network on each view. We then apply co-training by
enforcing multi-view consistency on unlabeled data, where an uncertainty
estimation of each view is utilized to achieve accurate labeling. Experiments
on the NIH pancreas segmentation dataset and a multi-organ segmentation dataset
show state-of-the-art performance of the proposed framework on semi-supervised
medical image segmentation. Under unsupervised domain adaptation settings, we
validate the effectiveness of this work by adapting our multi-organ

Yet, models based on CNNs remain susceptible to the domain shift problem, where a mismatch between source and target distributions could lead to a drop in performance. CNNs were recently shown to exhibit a textural bias when processing natural images, and recent studies suggest that this bias also extends to the context of biomedical imaging. In this paper, we focus on Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) and investigate textural bias in the context of ${k}$ -space artifacts (Gibbs, spike, and wraparound artifacts), which naturally manifest in clinical MRI scans. We show that carefully introducing such artifacts at training time can help reduce textural bias, and consequently lead to CNN models that are more robust to acquisition noise and out-of-distribution inference, including scans from hospitals not seen during training. We also present Gibbs ResUnet; a novel, end-to-end framework that automatically finds an optimal combination of Gibbs ${k}$ -space stylizations and segmentation model weights.

classification and segmentation with neural networks. Still, there exist a
variety of other potential output activation functions, which may lead to
improved results in medical image segmentation. In this work, we consider how
the asymptotic behavior of different output activation and loss functions
affects the prediction probabilities and the corresponding segmentation errors.
For cross entropy, we show that a faster rate of change of the activation
function correlates with better predictions, while a slower rate of change can
improve the calibration of probabilities. For dice loss, we found that the
arctangent activation function is superior to the sigmoid function.
Furthermore, we provide a test space for arbitrary output activation functions
in the area of medical image segmentation. We tested seven activation functions

890,pub.1135535334,10.3390/electronics10040431,,,Numerical Evaluation on Parametric Choices Influencing Segmentation Results in Radiology Images—A Multi-Dataset Study,"Medical image segmentation has gained greater attention over the past decade, especially in the field of image-guided surgery. Here, robust, accurate and fast segmentation tools are important for planning and navigation. In this work, we explore the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based approaches for multi-dataset segmentation from CT examinations. We hypothesize that selection of certain parameters in the network architecture design critically influence the segmentation results. We have employed two different CNN architectures, 3D-UNet and VGG-16, given that both networks are well accepted in the medical domain for segmentation tasks. In order to understand the efficiency of different parameter choices, we have adopted two different approaches. The first one combines different weight initialization schemes with different activation functions, whereas the second approach combines different weight initialization methods with a set of loss functions and optimizers. For evaluation, the 3D-UNet was trained with the Medical Segmentation Decathlon dataset and VGG-16 using LiTS data. The quality assessment done using eight quantitative metrics enhances the probability of using our proposed strategies for enhancing the segmentation results. Following a systematic approach in the evaluation of the results, we propose a few strategies that can be adopted for obtaining good segmentation results. Both of the architectures used in this work were selected on the basis of general acceptance in segmentation tasks for medical images based on their promising results compared to other state-of-the art networks. The highest Dice score obtained in 3D-UNet for the liver, pancreas and cardiac data was 0.897, 0.691 and 0.892. In the case of VGG-16, it was solely developed to work with liver data and delivered a Dice score of 0.921. From all the experiments conducted, we observed that two of the combinations with Xavier weight initialization (also known as Glorot), Adam optimiser, Cross Entropy loss (GloCEAdam) and LeCun weight initialization, cross entropy loss and Adam optimiser LecCEAdam worked best for most of the metrics in a 3D-UNet setting, while Xavier together with cross entropy loss and Tanh activation function (GloCEtanh) worked best for the VGG-16 network. Here, the parameter combinations are proposed on the basis of their contributions in obtaining optimal outcomes in segmentation evaluations. Moreover, we discuss that the preliminary evaluation results show that these parameters could later on be used for gaining more insights into model convergence and optimal solutions.The results from the quality assessment metrics and the statistical analysis validate our conclusions and we propose that the presented work can be used as a guide in choosing parameters for the best possible segmentation results for future works.",All the datasets that have been used for the training and validation are obtained from the public database.

computer assisted intervention and diagnosis methods. In recent years,
convolutional neural networks have dominated the state of the art in this task.
However, since this problem presents a challenging environment due to high
variability in the organ's shape and similarity between tissues, the generation
of false negative and false positive regions in the output segmentation is a
common issue. Recent works have shown that the uncertainty analysis of the
model can provide us with useful information about potential errors in the
segmentation. In this context, we proposed a segmentation refinement method
based on uncertainty analysis and graph convolutional networks. We employ the
uncertainty levels of the convolutional network in a particular input volume to
formulate a semi-supervised graph learning problem that is solved by training a
graph convolutional network. To test our method we refine the initial output of
a 2D U-Net. We validate our framework with the NIH pancreas dataset and the
spleen dataset of the medical segmentation decathlon. We show that our method
outperforms the state-of-the-art CRF refinement method by improving the dice
score by 1% for the pancreas and 2% for spleen, with respect to the original
U-Net's prediction. Finally, we perform a sensitivity analysis on the
parameters of our proposal and discuss the applicability to other CNN
architectures, the results, and current limitations of the model for future

In order to execute organ segmentation separately on the input MR image, the multi-annotator segmentation framework employs a number of distinct deep learning-based models with diverse loss functions, algorithms, and architectures. Each deep learning model generates a probability map, which is then fused by decision fusion algorithms or a deep learning-based combiner to produce a single binary map of the target organ/structure. The purpose of the multi-annotator segmentation method is to make use of the complimentary information generated/provided by the several independent annotators (independent deep learning models). This approach would profit from the synergistic impact of integrating the different annotators' decisions to achieve a better performance than each annotator working alone. For the delineation of the hippocampus head and body from MR images, the performance of the suggested multi-annotator approach was examined. Other segmentation approaches were used for evaluation, including a multi-view deep learning-based technique, Atlas-based methods, shape-based averaging (SBA), STAPLE, and majority voting. A variety of deep learning methods (including several architectures and loss functions) were implemented, with a residual architecture (ResNet-CE) with dilated convolutional kernels and a cross-entropy loss function demon-strating higher performance as a standalone model. For the body and head of the hippocampus, the ResNet-CE model attained Dice indices of 88 ±61.7 and 88 ±71.5, respectively. Overall, the suggested multi-annotator segmentation strategy beat other segmentation approaches with Dice indices of 91 ±01.3 for the body and 91 ±11.3 for the head, containing six separate deep learning models, including the ResNet model. Dice indices of 88 ±41.5 for the body and 88 ±51.5 for the head were obtained using the best atlas-based approach, and Dice indices of 88 ±91.5 (body) and 89 ±01.4 (head) were obtained using the multi-view segmentation method (head). This research showed that the proposed multi-annotator technique for seminal segmentation outperforms each of the annotators individually (independent deep learning models which are included in the multi-annotator approach). The proposed method could be used to improve the overall accuracy and performance of machine learning and/or deep learning-based approaches in seminal segmentation challenges.",,This work was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation under grant SNRF 320030_176052.,,2021 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium and Medical Imaging Conference (NSS/MIC),,2021-10-23,2021,,2021-10-23,0,,1-3,Closed,Proceeding,"Arabi, Hossein; Zaidi, Habib","Arabi, Hossein (Division of Nuclear Medicine & Molecular Imaging, Geneva University Hospital, CH-1211, Geneva, Switzerland); Zaidi, Habib (Division of Nuclear Medicine & Molecular Imaging, Geneva University Hospital, CH-1211, Geneva, Switzerland)","Zaidi, Habib (University Hospital of Geneva)","Arabi, Hossein (University Hospital of Geneva); Zaidi, Habib (University Hospital of Geneva)",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1150895527,46 Information and Computing Sciences, 4611 Machine Learning,,,,,,,,,,,

latter allows more flexibility but is prone to overfitting. In this paper, we
advocate a hybrid approach representing shapes in terms of 3D meshes with a
separate latent vector at each vertex. During training the latent vectors are
constrained to have the same value, which avoids overfitting. For inference,
the latent vectors are updated independently while imposing spatial

achieved promising results in various medical image analysis tasks. Many recent
approaches have also extended U-Net with more complex building blocks, which
typically increase the number of network parameters considerably. Such
complexity makes the inference stage highly inefficient for clinical
applications. Towards an effective yet economic segmentation network design, in
this work, we propose backward skip connections that bring decoded features
back to the encoder. Our design can be jointly adopted with forward skip
connections in any encoder-decoder architecture forming a recurrence structure
without introducing extra parameters. With the backward skip connections, we
propose a U-Net based network family, namely Bi-directional O-shape networks,
which set new benchmarks on multiple public medical imaging segmentation
datasets. On the other hand, with the most plain architecture (BiO-Net),
network computations inevitably increase along with the pre-set recurrence
time. We have thus studied the deficiency bottleneck of such recurrent design
and propose a novel two-phase Neural Architecture Search (NAS) algorithm,
namely BiX-NAS, to search for the best multi-scale bi-directional skip
connections. The ineffective skip connections are then discarded to reduce
computational costs and speed up network inference. The finally searched
BiX-Net yields the least network complexity and outperforms other
state-of-the-art counterparts by large margins. We evaluate our methods on both

In previous works, most classical methods are using 2D convolution to extract feature from a single direction without making information of z-axis into consideration and haven’t considered that information representations are different in every view direction. In this letter, an attention mechanism-based model is proposed to extract and utilize feature more efficiently under the consideration of various information representation from direction to direction. To reach this goal, the work mainly consists of three parts of characteristics. The first characteristic is a plug-and-play structure design with parallel feature extractor in the different axial directions of which is dedicated to solving the problem of losing spatial structure feature by traditional 2D convolution.

learning (DL) based solutions for image compression. An image can be compressed
by training an INR model with fewer weights than the number of image pixels to
map the coordinates of the image to corresponding pixel values. While
traditional training approaches for INRs are based on enforcing pixel-wise
image consistency, we propose to further improve image quality by using a new
structural regularizer. We present structural regularization for INR
compression (SINCO) as a novel INR method for image compression. SINCO imposes
structural consistency of the compressed images to the groundtruth by using a
segmentation network to penalize the discrepancy of segmentation masks
predicted from compressed images. We validate SINCO on brain MRI images by
showing that it can achieve better performance than some recent INR methods.",,,arXiv,,,2022-10-26,2022,,,,,,All OA, Green,Preprint,"Gao, Harry; Gan, Weijie; Sun, Zhixin; Kamilov, Ulugbek S.","Gao, Harry (); Gan, Weijie (); Sun, Zhixin (); Kamilov, Ulugbek S.

RV failure has numerous causes, including pulmonary hypertension, myocardial infarction, and congenital heart disease. However, assessment of the RV is more challenging than the LV due to its complex shape and thin walls. This study proposes an automated approach to delineate the RV from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans using a deep convolutional neural network approach. The proposed method uses nnU-Net, a self-adapting framework based on the U-Net neural network approach for the segmentation of the RV from short and long axis MRI images at the end-systolic and end-diastolic phases of the heart. The proposed neural network models were trained using the datasets provided by Multi-Disease, Multi-View & Multi-Center Right Ventricular Segmentation in Cardiac MRI Challenge hosted by MICCAI 2021 conference.

Despite their high accuracy, these models may however yield predictions that are considered anatomically impossible by clinicians. Moreover, incorporating complex anatomical constraints into standard deep learning frameworks remains challenging due to their non-differentiable nature. To address these limitations, we propose a Constrained Adversarial Training (CAT) method that learns how to produce anatomically plausible segmentations. Unlike approaches focusing solely on accuracy measures like Dice, our method considers complex anatomical constraints like connectivity, convexity, and symmetry which cannot be easily modeled in a loss function. The problem of non-differentiable constraints is solved using a Reinforce algorithm which enables to obtain a gradient for violated constraints. To generate constraint-violating examples on the fly, and thereby obtain useful gradients, our method adopts an adversarial training strategy which modifies training images to maximize the constraint loss, and then updates the network to be robust to these adversarial examples. The proposed method offers a generic and efficient way to add complex segmentation constraints on top of any segmentation network.

The challenges of collecting such datasets, especially in case of 3D volumes, motivate to develop approaches that can learn from other types of labels that are cheap to obtain, e.g. bounding boxes. We focus on 3D medical images with their corresponding 3D bounding boxes which are considered as series of per-slice non-tight 2D bounding boxes. While current weakly-supervised approaches that use 2D bounding boxes as weak labels can be applied to medical image segmentation, we show that their success is limited in cases when the assumption about the tightness of the bounding boxes breaks. We propose a new bounding box correction framework which is trained on a small set of pixel-level annotations to improve the tightness of a larger set of non-tight bounding box annotations. The effectiveness of our solution is demonstrated by evaluating a known weakly-supervised segmentation approach with and without the proposed bounding box correction algorithm. When the tightness is improved by our solution, the results of the weakly-supervised segmentation become much closer to those of the fully-supervised one.",,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science,"Deep Generative Models, and Data Augmentation, Labelling, and Imperfections",,2021-09-25,2021,2021-09-25,2021,13003,,193-200,All OA, Green,Chapter,"Redekop, Ekaterina; Chernyavskiy, Alexey","Redekop, Ekaterina (Philips AI Research, Moscow, Russia); Chernyavskiy, Alexey (Philips AI Research, Moscow, Russia)","Chernyavskiy, Alexey ","Redekop, Ekaterina (); Chernyavskiy, Alexey ()",1,1,,0.92,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.03300,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1141489940,"46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4607 Graphics, Augmented Reality and Games",,,,,,,,,,,

Chest CT scans show high potential for detecting pathological manifestations. Hence, the demand for computer-aided tools to support radiologists has grown exponentially. In this work, we developed a deep learning based algorithm, with an emphasis on novel transfer learning methods, to segment COVID-19 opacity in chest CT scans.

in medical imaging, owing to its multiple downstream clinical applications. As
a result, many large-scale segmentation datasets have been curated and released
for the segmentation of different anatomical structures. However, these
datasets focus on the segmentation of a subset of anatomical structures in the
body, therefore, training a model for each dataset would potentially result in
hundreds of models and thus limit their clinical translational utility.
Furthermore, many of these datasets share the same field of view but have
different subsets of annotations, thus making individual dataset annotations
incomplete. To that end, we developed SegViz, a federated learning framework
for aggregating knowledge from distributed medical image segmentation datasets
with different and incomplete annotations into a `global` meta-model. The
SegViz framework was trained to build a single model capable of segmenting both
liver and spleen aggregating knowledge from both these nodes by aggregating the
weights after every 10 epochs. The global SegViz model was tested on an
external dataset, Beyond the Cranial Vault (BTCV), comprising both liver and
spleen annotations using the dice similarity (DS) metric. The baseline
individual segmentation models for spleen and liver trained on their respective
datasets produced a DS score of 0.834 and 0.878 on the BTCV test set. In
comparison, the SegViz model produced comparable mean DS scores of 0.829 and
0.899 for the segmentation of the spleen and liver respectively. Our results
demonstrate SegViz as an essential first step towards training clinically
translatable multi-task segmentation models from distributed datasets with
disjoint incomplete annotations with excellent performance.",,,arXiv,,,2023-01-17,2023,,,,,,All OA, Green,Preprint,"Kanhere, Adway U.; Kulkarni, Pranav; Yi, Paul H.; Parekh, Vishwa S.","Kanhere, Adway U.

Some organs are more challenging to delineate than others, for instance due to low contrast at their boundaries. In this paper, we propose to improve the segmentation of elongated organs thanks to Geometrical Priors that can be introduced during training, using a local Tversky loss function, or at post-processing, using local thresholds. Both strategies do not introduce additional training parameters and can be easily applied to any existing network. The proposed method is evaluated on the challenging problem of pancreas segmentation. Results show that Geometrical Priors allow us to correct the systematic under-segmentation pattern of a state-of-the-art method, while preserving the overall segmentation quality.","This work was partly funded by a CIFRE grant from ANRT # 2020/1448.

learning has recently attracted attention as a first-line automatic testing
tool because of its high accuracy and low radiation exposure. However, existing
methods rely on supervised learning, imposing an additional burden to doctors
for collecting disease data or annotating spatial labels for network training,
consequently hindering their implementation. We propose a method based on a
deep neural network for computer-aided diagnosis called virtual multi-view
projection and reconstruction for unsupervised anomaly detection. Presumably,
this is the first method that only requires data from healthy patients for
training to identify three-dimensional (3D) regions containing any anomalies.
The method has three key components. Unlike existing computer-aided diagnosis
tools that use conventional CT slices as the network input, our method 1)
improves the recognition of 3D lung structures by virtually projecting an
extracted 3D lung region to obtain two-dimensional (2D) images from diverse
views to serve as network inputs, 2) accommodates the input diversity gain for
accurate anomaly detection, and 3) achieves 3D anomaly/disease localization
through a novel 3D map restoration method using multiple 2D anomaly maps. The
proposed method based on unsupervised learning improves the patient-level
anomaly detection by 10% (area under the curve, 0.959) compared with a gold
standard based on supervised learning (area under the curve, 0.848), and it

However, manual tuning is infeasible for a large number of parameters, and existing automatic HPO methods like Bayesian optimization are extremely time consuming. Moreover, they can only find a fixed set of hyperparameters. Population based training (PBT) has shown its ability to find dynamic hyperparameters and has fast search speed by using parallel training processes. However, it is still expensive for large 3D medical image datasets with limited GPUs, and the performance lower bound is unknown.

The recent need for developing accurate as well as robust systems has led to breakthroughs making advantage of deep learning, but requiring significant amounts of labeled data, which, in turn, is costly and hardly obtainable. In this work, we try to address this issue by introducing self-supervised learning for hippocampus segmentation. We devise a new framework, based on the widely known method of Jigsaw puzzle reassembly, in which we first pre-train using one of the unlabeled MRI datasets, and then perform a downstream segmentation training with other labeled datasets. As a result, we found our method to capture local-level features for better learning of anatomical information pertaining to brain MRI images.

The design of the best possible medical image segmentation DNNs, however, is task-specific. Neural Architecture Search (NAS), i.e., the automation of neural network design, has been shown to have the capability to outperform manually designed networks for various tasks. However, the existing NAS methods for medical image segmentation have explored a quite limited range of types of DNN architectures that can be discovered. In this work, we propose a novel NAS search space for medical image segmentation networks. This search space combines the strength of a generalised encoder-decoder structure, well known from U-Net, with network blocks that have proven to have a strong performance in image classification tasks. The search is performed by looking for the best topology of multiple cells simultaneously with the configuration of each cell within, allowing for interactions between topology and cell-level attributes.

people around the world die from clinically significant PCa (csPCa). Early
diagnosis of csPCa in bi-parametric MRI (bpMRI), which is non-invasive,
cost-effective, and more efficient compared to multiparametric MRI (mpMRI), can
contribute to precision care for PCa. The rapid rise in artificial intelligence
(AI) algorithms are enabling unprecedented improvements in providing decision
support systems that can aid in csPCa diagnosis and understanding. However,
existing state of the art AI algorithms which are based on deep learning
technology are often limited to 2D images that fails to capture inter-slice
correlations in 3D volumetric images. The use of 3D convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) partly overcomes this limitation, but it does not adapt to the
anisotropy of images, resulting in sub-optimal semantic representation and poor
generalization. Furthermore, due to the limitation of the amount of labelled
data of bpMRI and the difficulty of labelling, existing CNNs are built on
relatively small datasets, leading to a poor performance. To address the
limitations identified above, we propose a new Zonal-aware Self-supervised Mesh

effectively balance representation for sparse inter-slice information and dense
intra-slice information in bpMRI. A self-supervised learning (SSL) technique is
further introduced to pre-train our network using unlabelled data to learn the

Deep learning-based supervised segmentation models have achieved state-of-the-art performance, but most of them are limited by using pixel-wise loss functions for training without geometrical constraints. Inspired by the Euler’s Elastica model and recent active contour models introduced into deep learning, we propose a novel active contour with an elastic (ACE) loss function. The ACE loss function incorporates Elastica knowledge as geometrically-natural constraints for the image segmentation tasks. In the ACE loss function, we introduce the mean curvature, i.e. the average of all principal curvatures, as a more compelling image prior to represent the curvature. Furthermore, based on the mean curvature definition, we propose a fast solution (Fast-ACE) to approximate our ACE loss with Laplace operators for three-dimensional (3D) image segmentation. We evaluate our ACE loss and Fast-ACE loss functions on one two-dimensional (2D) dataset and one 3D biomedical image dataset.

Many improvements focus on the design of encoders, decoders and skip connections. Due to the intrinsic property of convolutional kernels, convolution-based encoders suffer from limited receptive fields. To deal with that, recently proposed Transformer-based networks leveraging the self-attention mechanism build long-range dependency. However, they are highly reliable on pretrained weights from natural images. In our work, we find out ViT-based (Vision Transformer) models’ performance will not decrease significantly without pretrained weights even if there is a limited data source. So we flexibly design a 3D medical Transformer for image segmentation and train it from scratch. Specifically, we introduce Multi-Scale Dynamic Positional Embeddings to ViT to dynamically acquire positional information of each 3D patch. Positional bias can also enrich attention diversities. Moreover, we give detailed reasons why we choose the convolution-based decoder instead of recently proposed Swin Transformer blocks after preliminary experiments on the decoder design. Finally, we propose the Context Enhancement Module to refine skipped features by merging low and high-frequency information via a combination of convolutional kernels and self-attention modules.

Deep learning models backboned by fully convolutional neural networks (FCNNs) have become the dominant model for segmenting 3D computerized tomography (CT) scans. However, since their convolution layers suffer from limited kernel size, they are not able to capture long-range dependencies and global context. To tackle this restriction, vision transformers have been introduced to solve FCNN’s locality of receptive fields. Although transformers can capture long-range features, their segmentation performance decreases with various tumor sizes due to the model sensitivity to the input patch size. While finding an optimal patch size improves the performance of vision transformer-based models on segmentation tasks, it is a time-consuming and challenging procedure. This paper proposes a technique to select the vision transformer’s optimal input multi-resolution image patch size based on the average volume size of metastasis lesions. We further validated our suggested framework using a transfer-learning technique, demonstrating that the highest Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) performance was obtained by pre-training on training data with a larger tumour volume using the suggested ideal patch size and then training with a smaller one. We experimentally evaluate this idea through pre-training our model on a multi-resolution public dataset. Our model showed consistent and improved results when applied to our private multi-resolution mCRC dataset with a smaller average tumor volume. This study lays the groundwork for optimizing semantic segmentation of small objects using vision transformers.

isolated patient data owned by different hospitals for various clinical
applications, including medical image segmentation. However, a major problem of
FL is its performance degradation when dealing with the data that are not
independently and identically distributed (non-iid), which is often the case in
medical images. In this paper, we first conduct a theoretical analysis on the
FL algorithm to reveal the problem of model aggregation during training on
non-iid data. With the insights gained through the analysis, we propose a
simple and yet effective method, federated cross learning (FedCross), to tackle
this challenging problem. Unlike the conventional FL methods that combine
multiple individually trained local models on a server node, our FedCross
sequentially trains the global model across different clients in a round-robin
manner, and thus the entire training procedure does not involve any model
aggregation steps. To further improve its performance to be comparable with the
centralized learning method, we combine the FedCross with an ensemble learning
mechanism to compose a federated cross ensemble learning (FedCrossEns) method.
Finally, we conduct extensive experiments using a set of public datasets. The
experimental results show that the proposed FedCross training strategy
outperforms the mainstream FL methods on non-iid data. In addition to improving
the segmentation performance, our FedCrossEns can further provide a
quantitative estimation of the model uncertainty, demonstrating the
effectiveness and clinical significance of our designs. Source code will be

Monitoring of traffic-induced dust is an essential part of unsealed road maintenance. The measurement of the degree of severity of dust emissions is a challenging task due to dust's spatio-temporal characteristics, the requirement for expensive equipment, and rapidly changing environmental conditions. The next evolution of mobility solutions for unsealed roads calls for more robust, time-efficient and smart methods, such as machine learning techniques to solve dust-related road problems. This paper investigates the performance of current semantic segmentation machine learning models on the identification of dust clouds using the previously published URDE dataset. Based on static image performance, the selected models are then used to identify and segment dust clouds in video recordings of road dust emissions. These are used to visually analyse the segmentation quality of the best-performing machine learning models and determine whether the development of novel machine learning models for segmentation of dust is necessary.

Usually, SSL relies on measuring the similarity of features obtained at the deepest layer to attract the features of positive pairs or repulse the features of negative pairs, and then may suffer from the weak supervision at shallow layers. To address this issue, we reformulate SSL in a Deep Self-Distillation (DeSD) manner to improve the representation quality of both shallow and deep layers. Specifically, the DeSD model is composed of an online student network and a momentum teacher network, both being stacked by multiple sub-encoders. The features produced by each sub-encoder in the student network are trained to match the features produced by the teacher network. Such a deep self-distillation supervision is able to improve the representation quality of all sub-encoders, including both shallow ones and deep ones. We pre-train the DeSD model on a large-scale unlabeled dataset and evaluate it on seven downstream segmentation tasks.

computer vision for the past few years. It is essential for medical image
analysis, which is often notorious for its lack of annotations. Most existing
self-supervised methods applied in natural imaging tasks focus on designing
proxy tasks for unlabeled data. For example, contrastive learning is often
based on the fact that an image and its transformed version share the same
identity. However, pixel annotations contain much valuable information for
medical image segmentation, which is largely ignored in contrastive learning.
In this work, we propose a novel pre-training framework called Mixed
Contrastive Learning (MixCL) that leverages both image identities and pixel
labels for better modeling by maintaining identity consistency, label
consistency, and reconstruction consistency together. Consequently, thus
pre-trained model has more robust representations that characterize medical

we propose a data manipulation based domain generalization method, called
Automated Augmentation for Domain Generalization (AADG). Our AADG framework can
effectively sample data augmentation policies that generate novel domains and
diversify the training set from an appropriate search space. Specifically, we
introduce a novel proxy task maximizing the diversity among multiple augmented

However, they always cover a diverse set of structures, causing difficulties for the segmentation model to learn good decision boundaries with high sensitivity and precision. The issue concerns the highly heterogeneous nature of the background class, resulting in multi-modal distributions. Empirically, we find that neural networks trained with heterogeneous background struggle to map the corresponding contextual samples to compact clusters in feature space. As a result, the distribution over background logit activations may shift across the decision boundary, leading to systematic over-segmentation across different datasets and tasks. In this study, we propose context label learning (CoLab) to improve the context representations by decomposing the background class into several subclasses. Specifically, we train an auxiliary network as a task generator, along with the primary segmentation model, to automatically generate context labels that positively affect the ROI segmentation accuracy. Extensive experiments are conducted on several challenging segmentation tasks and datasets. The results demonstrate that CoLab can guide the segmentation model to map the logits of background samples away from the decision boundary, resulting in significantly improved segmentation accuracy.

743,pub.1146782323,10.2139/ssrn.4065778,,,Robustness of Different Loss Functions and Their Impact on Network's Learning,"Recent developments in AI have made it ubiquitous, every industry is trying to adopt some form of intelligent processing of their data. Despite so many advances in the field, AI’s full capability is yet to be exploited by the industry. Industries that involve some risk factors still remain cautious about the usage of AI due to the lack of trust in such autonomous systems. Present-day AI might be very good in a lot of things but it is very bad in reasoning and this behavior of AI can lead to catastrophic results. Autonomous cars crashing into a person or a drone getting stuck in a tree are a few examples where AI decisions lead to catastrophic results. To develop insight and generate an explanation about the learning capability of AI, we will try to analyze the working of loss functions. For our case, we will use two sets of loss functions, generalized loss functions like Binary cross-entropy or BCE and specialized loss functions like Dice loss or focal loss. Through a series of experiments, we will establish whether combining different loss functions is better than using a single loss function and if yes, then what is the reason behind it. In order to establish the difference between generalized loss and specialized losses, we will train several models using the above-mentioned losses and then compare their robustness on adversarial examples. In particular, we will look at how fast the accuracy of different models decreases when we change the pixels corresponding to the most salient gradients.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,,2022,2022,,,,,,All OA, Green,Preprint,"Rajput, Vishal","Rajput, Vishal (affiliation not provided to SSRN)",,"Rajput, Vishal ()",1,1,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1146782323,46 Information and Computing Sciences, 4611 Machine Learning,,,,,,,,,,
742,pub.1153158793,10.48550/arxiv.2211.14051,,,Open-Source Skull Reconstruction with MONAI,"We present a deep learning-based approach for skull reconstruction for MONAI,
which has been pre-trained on the MUG500+ skull dataset. The implementation
follows the MONAI contribution guidelines, hence, it can be easily tried out
and used, and extended by MONAI users. The primary goal of this paper lies in
the investigation of open-sourcing codes and pre-trained deep learning models
under the MONAI framework. Nowadays, open-sourcing software, especially
(pre-trained) deep learning models, has become increasingly important. Over the
years, medical image analysis experienced a tremendous transformation. Over a
decade ago, algorithms had to be implemented and optimized with low-level
programming languages, like C or C++, to run in a reasonable time on a desktop
PC, which was not as powerful as today's computers. Nowadays, users have
high-level scripting languages like Python, and frameworks like PyTorch and
TensorFlow, along with a sea of public code repositories at hand. As a result,
implementations that had thousands of lines of C or C++ code in the past, can
now be scripted with a few lines and in addition executed in a fraction of the
time. To put this even on a higher level, the Medical Open Network for
Artificial Intelligence (MONAI) framework tailors medical imaging research to
an even more convenient process, which can boost and push the whole field. The
MONAI framework is a freely available, community-supported, open-source and
PyTorch-based framework, that also enables to provide research contributions
with pre-trained models to others. Codes and pre-trained weights for skull
reconstruction are publicly available at:

Compared with MRI and CT Colonography, regular CT has a broader application but is more challenging. Standard segmentation algorithms often induce discontinued colon prediction, leading to inaccurate or completely failed CRC segmentation. To tackle this issue, we establish a new 1D colorectal coordinate system that encodes the position information along the colorectal elongated topology. In addition to the regular segmentation task, we propose an auxiliary regression task that directly predicts the colorectal coordinate for each voxel. This task integrates the global topological information into the network embedding and thus improves the continuity of the colorectum and the accuracy of the tumor segmentation. To enhance the model’s architectural ability of modeling global context, we add self-attention layers to the model backbone, and found it complementary to the proposed algorithm. We validate our approach on a cross-validation of 107 cases and outperform nnUNet by an absolute margin of 1.3% in colorectum segmentation and 8.3% in CRC segmentation. Notably, we achieve comparable tumor segmentation performance with the human inter-observer (DSC: 0.646 vs. 0.639), indicating that our method has similar reproducibility as a human observer.","This study was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China [grant number 2021YFF1201003], the National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars [grant number 81925023], the National Natural Scientific Foundation of China [grant number 82072090].",,Lecture Notes in Computer Science,Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention – MICCAI 2022,,2022-09-16,2022,2022-09-16,2022,13433,,564-573,Closed,Chapter,"Yao, Lisha; Xia, Yingda; Zhang, Haochen; Yao, Jiawen; Jin, Dakai; Qiu, Bingjiang; Zhang, Yuan; Li, Suyun; Liang, Yanting; Hua, Xian-Sheng; Lu, Le; Chen, Xin; Liu, Zaiyi; Zhang, Ling","Yao, Lisha (Guangdong Provincial People’s Hospital, Guangzhou, China; South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China); Xia, Yingda (Alibaba Group, Hangzhou, China); Zhang, Haochen (Guangdong Provincial People’s Hospital, Guangzhou, China; South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China); Yao, Jiawen (Alibaba Group, Hangzhou, China); Jin, Dakai (Alibaba Group, Hangzhou, China); Qiu, Bingjiang (Guangdong Provincial People’s Hospital, Guangzhou, China); Zhang, Yuan (Guangdong Provincial People’s Hospital, Guangzhou, China); Li, Suyun (Guangdong Provincial People’s Hospital, Guangzhou, China; South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China); Liang, Yanting (Guangdong Provincial People’s Hospital, Guangzhou, China; South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China); Hua, Xian-Sheng (Alibaba Group, Hangzhou, China); Lu, Le (Alibaba Group, Hangzhou, China); Chen, Xin (South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China; Guangzhou First People’s Hospital, Guangzhou, China); Liu, Zaiyi (Guangdong Provincial People’s Hospital, Guangzhou, China; South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China); Zhang, Ling (Alibaba Group, Hangzhou, China)","Xia, Yingda (Alibaba Group (China))","Yao, Lisha (Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital; South China University of Technology); Xia, Yingda (Alibaba Group (China)); Zhang, Haochen (Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital; South China University of Technology); Yao, Jiawen (Alibaba Group (China)); Jin, Dakai (Alibaba Group (China)); Qiu, Bingjiang (Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital); Zhang, Yuan (Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital); Li, Suyun (Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital; South China University of Technology); Liang, Yanting (Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital; South China University of Technology); Hua, Xian-Sheng (Alibaba Group (China)); Lu, Le (Alibaba Group (China)); Chen, Xin (South China University of Technology; Guangzhou First People's Hospital); Liu, Zaiyi (Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital; South China University of Technology); Zhang, Ling (Alibaba Group (China))",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1151032881,46 Information and Computing Sciences,,,,,,,,,,,,
742,pub.1135529077,10.1117/12.2582241,,,Progressive medical image annotation with convolutional neural network-based interactive segmentation method,"Deep learning-based segmentation algorithms for medical image require massive training datasets with accurate annotations, which is costly since it takes much human effort to manually labeling from scratch. Therefore, interactive image segmentation is important and may greatly improve the efficiency and accuracy of medical image labeling. Some interactive segmentation methods (e.g. Deep Extreme Cut and Deepgrow) may improve the labeling through minimal interactive input. However these methods only utilize the initial manually input information, while existing segmentation results (such as annotations produced by nonprofessionals or conventional segmentation algorithms) cannot be utilized. In this paper, an interactive segmentation method is proposed to make use of both existing segmentation results and human interactive information to optimize the segmentation results progressively. In this framework, the user only needs to click on the foreground or background of the target individual on the medical image, the algorithm could adaptively learn the correlation between them, and automatically completes the segmentation of the target. The main contributions of this paper are: (1) We adjusted and applied a convolutional neural network which takes medical image data and user's clicks information as input to achieve more accurate segmentation of medical images. (2) We designed an iterative training strategy to realize the applicability of the model to deal with different number of clicks data input. (3) We designed an algorithm based on false positive and false negative regions to simulate the user's clicks, so as to provide enough training data. By applying the proposed method, users can easily extract the region of interest or modify the segmentation results by multiple clicks. The experimental results of 6 medical image segmentation tasks show that the proposed method achieves more accurate segmentation results by at most five clicks.",,,Progress in Biomedical Optics and Imaging,Medical Imaging 2021: Image Processing,,2021-02-15,2021,,,11596,,115962q-115962q-11,Closed,Proceeding,"Bai, Yunkun; Sun, Guangmin; Li, Yu; Shen, Le; Zhang, Li","Bai, Yunkun (Beijing Univ. of Technology (China)); Sun, Guangmin (Beijing Univ. of Technology (China)); Li, Yu (Beijing Univ. of Technology (China)); Shen, Le (Tsinghua Univ.

been the most striking successes for feature extraction of rich sensory and
high-dimensional data. While learning data representations via convolutions is
already well studied and efficiently implemented in various deep learning
libraries, one often faces limited memory capacity and insufficient number of
training data, especially for high-dimensional and large-scale tasks. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce a network architecture using a
self-adjusting and data dependent version of the Radon-transform (linear data
projection), also known as x-ray projection, to enable feature extraction via
convolutions in lower-dimensional space. The resulting framework, named PiNet,
can be trained end-to-end and shows promising performance on volumetric
segmentation tasks. We test proposed model on public datasets to show that our
approach achieves comparable results only using fractional amount of

To address these challenges, we propose an end-to-end domain adaptive collaborative learning network for multi-institutional prostate MRI segmentation. Specifically, we introduce an unpaired image translation module to match the image domains between different institutions, which can alleviate the heterogeneity between 1.5T and 3T prostate MR images during model training. Moreover, we design a self-taught strategy to transfer domain-aware knowledge to jointly learn generic and unique representations. Furthermore, we evaluate our approach in scenarios with limited or without annotations, experimental results show that our approach has better adaptation performance than traditional supervised learning approaches, and has the potential to extend to unsupervised domain adaptation scenario.

We propose a two-phase OMT algorithm with density estimates for 3D brain tumor segmentation. In the first phase, we construct a volume-mass-preserving OMT via the density determined by the FLAIR grayscale of the scanned modality for the U-net and predict the possible tumor regions. Then, in the second phase, we increase the density on the region of interest and construct a new OMT to enlarge the target region of tumors for the U-net so that the U-net has a better chance to learn how to mark the correct segmentation labels.

TransFuse combines Transformers and CNNs in a parallel style, where both global
dependency and low-level spatial details can be efficiently captured in a much
shallower manner. Besides, a novel fusion technique - BiFusion module is
created to efficiently fuse the multi-level features from both branches.

Automatic rib segmentation methods can speed up the process through rib measurement and visualization. However, prior arts mostly use in-house labeled datasets that are publicly unavailable and work on dense 3D volumes that are computationally inefficient. To address these issues, we develop a labeled rib segmentation benchmark, named RibSeg, including 490 CT scans (11,719 individual ribs) from a public dataset. For ground truth generation, we used existing morphology-based algorithms and manually refined its results. Then, considering the sparsity of ribs in 3D volumes, we thresholded and sampled sparse voxels from the input and designed a point cloud-based baseline method for rib segmentation. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance (Dice ≈95%\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

While learning data representations via convolutions is already well studied and efficiently implemented in various deep learning libraries, one often faces limited memory capacity and insufficient number of training data, especially for high-dimensional and large-scale tasks. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a network architecture using a self-adjusting and data dependent version of the Radon-transform (linear data projection), also known as X-ray projection, to enable feature extraction via convolutions in lower-dimensional space. The resulting framework, named PiNet, can be trained end-to-end and shows promising performance on volumetric segmentation tasks. We test proposed model on public datasets to show that our approach achieves comparable results only using fractional amount of parameters.

tasks, such as segmentation of different anatomical structures. With the
increased numbers of deep learning publications and openly available code, the
approach to choosing a model for a new task becomes more complicated, while

a model efficiently is meta-learning, a learning method in which prior
performance of a model is used to predict the performance for new tasks. We
investigate meta-learning for segmentation across ten datasets of different
organs and modalities. We propose four ways to represent each dataset by
meta-features: one based on statistical features of the images and three are
based on deep learning features. We use support vector regression and deep
neural networks to learn the relationship between the meta-features and prior
model performance. On three external test datasets these methods give Dice
scores within 0.10 of the true performance. These results demonstrate the

segmentation models should be trained on sizeable datasets with sufficient
variability. Due to ethics and governance restrictions, and the costs
associated with labelling data, scientific development is often stifled, with
models trained and tested on limited data. Data augmentation is often used to
artificially increase the variability in the data distribution and improve
model generalisability. Recent works have explored deep generative models for
image synthesis, as such an approach would enable the generation of an
effectively infinite amount of varied data, addressing the generalisability and
data access problems. However, many proposed solutions limit the user's control
over what is generated. In this work, we propose brainSPADE, a model which
combines a synthetic diffusion-based label generator with a semantic image
generator. Our model can produce fully synthetic brain labels on-demand, with
or without pathology of interest, and then generate a corresponding MRI image
of an arbitrary guided style. Experiments show that brainSPADE synthetic data
can be used to train segmentation models with performance comparable to that of

Most existing works improve model out-of-domain (OOD) robustness by collecting multi-domain datasets for training, which is expensive and may not always be feasible due to privacy and logistical issues. In this work, we focus on improving model robustness using a single-domain dataset only. We propose a novel data augmentation framework called MaxStyle, which maximizes the effectiveness of style augmentation for model OOD performance. It attaches an auxiliary style-augmented image decoder to a segmentation network for robust feature learning and data augmentation. Importantly, MaxStyle augments data with improved image style diversity and hardness, by expanding the style space with noise and searching for the worst-case style composition of latent features via adversarial training. With extensive experiments on multiple public cardiac and prostate MR datasets, we demonstrate that MaxStyle leads to significantly improved out-of-distribution robustness against unseen corruptions as well as common distribution shifts across multiple, different, unseen sites and unknown image sequences under both low- and high-training data settings.

However, it exhibits general limitations on modeling explicit long-range relation, and existing cures, resorting to building deep encoders along with aggressive downsampling operations, leads to redundant deepened networks and loss of localized details. Hence, the segmentation task awaits a better solution to improve the efficiency of modeling global contexts while maintaining a strong grasp of low-level details. In this paper, we propose a novel parallel-in-branch architecture, TransFuse, to address this challenge.

Methods based on U-Net have demonstrated their scalability and achieved great success in different organ segmentation tasks. However, the limited number of data and labels hinders the training process of these methods. Moreover, traditional U-Net models based on convolutional neural networks suffer from limited receptive fields. Lacking the ability to model long-term dependencies from a global perspective, these methods are prone to produce false positive predictions. In this paper, we propose a new semi-supervised learning algorithm based on the vision transformer to overcome these challenges. The overall architecture of our method consists of three stages. In the first stage, we tackle the abdomen region location problem via a lightweight segmentation network. In the second stage, we adopt a vision transformer model equipped with a semi-supervised learning strategy to detect different abdominal organs. In the final stage, we attach multiple organ-specific segmentation networks to automatically segment organs from their bounding boxes. We evaluate our method on MICCAI FLARE 2022 challenge dataset.

In this work, we propose a novel interactive segmentation framework, where user clicks are dynamically adapted in size based on the current segmentation mask. The clicked regions form a weight map and are fed to a deep neural network together with the image, where the network learns to discriminate important regions through a novel weighted loss function. To evaluate our loss function, a state-of-the-art interactive V-Net (IV-Net) model which utilizes both foreground and background user clicks as the main method of interaction is employed. To further improve on the IV-Net, we propose the use of a two-stream fusion interactive If-Net (TSFIV-Net) which applies multimodal fusion to allow for the propagation of image feature information throughout the architecture. We train and validate both the models on the BCV dataset, while testing on both seen and unseen structures from the MSD dataset to determine the models generalization and segmentation abilities in comparison to the standard IV-Net. Applying adaptive user click sizes increases the overall dice score by 4.86 % and 8.59 % for seen and unseen structures respectively by utilizing only a single user interaction on the IV-Net compared to the original version, and 9.88% and 10.35% on the TSFIV-Net.",,This work was supported by a grant from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada,,2022 IEEE Eighth International Conference on Multimedia Big Data (BigMM),,2022-12-07,2022,,2022-12-07,0,,7-12,Closed,Proceeding,"Pirabaharan, Ragavie; Khan, Naimul","Pirabaharan, Ragavie (Electrical, Computer and Biomedical Engineering, Toronto Metropolitan University); Khan, Naimul (Electrical, Computer and Biomedical Engineering, Toronto Metropolitan University)",,"Pirabaharan, Ragavie (); Khan, Naimul ()",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1154062625,"46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4605 Data Management and Data Science; 4607 Graphics, Augmented Reality and Games",,,,,,,,,,,,

pre-training Vision Transformers (ViT) for natural image analysis. By
performing the pretext task of reconstructing the original image from only
partial observations, the encoder, which is a ViT, is encouraged to aggregate
contextual information to infer content in masked image regions. We believe
that this context aggregation ability is also essential to the medical image
domain where each anatomical structure is functionally and mechanically
connected to other structures and regions. However, there is no ImageNet-scale
medical image dataset for pre-training. Thus, in this paper, we investigate a
self pre-training paradigm with MAE for medical images, i.e., models are
pre-trained on the same target dataset. To validate the MAE self pre-training,
we consider three diverse medical image tasks including chest X-ray disease
classification, CT abdomen multi-organ segmentation and MRI brain tumor
segmentation. It turns out MAE self pre-training benefits all the tasks
markedly. Specifically, the mAUC on lung disease classification is increased by
9.4%. The average DSC on brain tumor segmentation is improved from 77.4% to
78.9%. Most interestingly, on the small-scale multi-organ segmentation dataset
(N=30), the average DSC improves from 78.8% to 83.5% and the HD95 is reduced by
60%, indicating its effectiveness in limited data scenarios. The segmentation

A possible solution to choosing a model efficiently is meta-learning, a learning method in which prior performance of a model is used to predict the performance for new tasks. We investigate meta-learning for segmentation across ten datasets of different organs and modalities.

However, due to the convolutional architectures having limited receptive fields, they cannot explicitly model the long-range dependencies in the medical image. Recently, Transformer can benefit from global dependencies using self-attention mechanisms and learn highly expressive representations. Some works were designed based on the Transformers, but the existing Transformers suffer from extreme computational and memories, and they cannot take full advantage of the powerful feature representations in 3D medical image segmentation. In this paper, we aim to connect the different resolution streams in parallel and propose a novel network, named Transformer based High Resolution Network (TransHRNet), with an Effective Transformer (EffTrans) block, which has sufficient feature representation even at high feature resolutions. Given a 3D image, the encoder first utilizes CNN to extract the feature representations to capture the local information, and then the different feature maps are reshaped elaborately for tokens that are fed into each Transformer stream in parallel to learn the global information and repeatedly exchange the information across streams. Unfortunately, the proposed framework based on the standard Transformer needs a huge amount of computation, thus we introduce a deep and effective Transformer to deliver better performance with fewer parameters. The proposed TransHRNet is evaluated on the Multi-Atlas Labeling Beyond the Cranial Vault (BCV) dataset that consists of 11 major human organs and the Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD) dataset for brain tumor and spleen segmentation tasks.

In recent years, Fully Convolutional Neural Networks (FCNNs) approaches have become the de facto standard for 3D medical image segmentation. The popular “U-shaped” network architecture has achieved state-of-the-art performance benchmarks on different 2D and 3D semantic segmentation tasks and across various imaging modalities. However, due to the limited kernel size of convolution layers in FCNNs, their performance of modeling long-range information is sub-optimal, and this can lead to deficiencies in the segmentation of tumors with variable sizes. On the other hand, transformer models have demonstrated excellent capabilities in capturing such long-range information in multiple domains, including natural language processing and computer vision. Inspired by the success of vision transformers and their variants, we propose a novel segmentation model termed Swin UNEt TRansformers (Swin UNETR). Specifically, the task of 3D brain tumor semantic segmentation is reformulated as a sequence to sequence prediction problem wherein multi-modal input data is projected into a 1D sequence of embedding and used as an input to a hierarchical Swin transformer as the encoder. The swin transformer encoder extracts features at five different resolutions by utilizing shifted windows for computing self-attention and is connected to an FCNN-based decoder at each resolution via skip connections.

However, the visual domain gap between these sets poses a challenge which prevents deep learning models from obtaining the results they have achieved most especially in the field of medical imaging. Recently, self-training with deep learning has become a powerful approach to leverage labelled training and unlabelled data. However, a challenge of generating noisy pseudo-labels and placing over-confident labelling belief on incorrect classes leads to deviation from the solution. To solve this challenge, the study investigates a curriculum-styled approach for deep semi-supervised segmentation which relaxes and treats pseudo-labels as continuous hidden variables by developing an adaptive pseudo-label generation strategy to jointly optimized the pseudo-label generation and selection process. A regularization scheme is further proposed to smoothen the probability outputs and sharpen the less represented pseudo-label regions. The proposed method was evaluated on three publicly available Computer Tomography (CT) scan benchmarks and extensive experiments on all modules have demonstrated the efficacy of the proposed method.","This work was partially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No. 61772006, Sub Project of Independent Scientific Research Project under Grant No. ZZKY-ZX-03-02-04, and the Special Fund for Bagui Scholars of Guangxi.",,Lecture Notes in Computer Science,Neural Information Processing,,2021-12-06,2021,2021-12-06,2021,13108,,77-90,Closed,Chapter,"Nartey, Obed Tettey; Yang, Guowu; Agyapong, Dorothy Araba Yakoba; Wu, JinZhao; Sarpong, Asare K.; Frempong, Lady Nadia","Nartey, Obed Tettey (Big Data Research Center, School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, 611731, Chengdu, China; School of Information and Software Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China); Yang, Guowu (Big Data Research Center, School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, 611731, Chengdu, China); Agyapong, Dorothy Araba Yakoba (Biomedical Engineering Program, Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, Kumasi, Ghana); Wu, JinZhao (The School of Computer Science and Electronic Information, Guangxi University, 530004, Nanning, China); Sarpong, Asare K.

Due to ethics and governance restrictions, and the costs associated with labelling data, scientific development is often stifled, with models trained and tested on limited data. Data augmentation is often used to artificially increase the variability in the data distribution and improve model generalisability. Recent works have explored deep generative models for image synthesis, as such an approach would enable the generation of an effectively infinite amount of varied data, addressing the generalisability and data access problems. However, many proposed solutions limit the user’s control over what is generated. In this work, we propose brainSPADE, a model which combines a synthetic diffusion-based label generator with a semantic image generator. Our model can produce fully synthetic brain labels on-demand, with or without pathology of interest, and then generate a corresponding MRI image of an arbitrary guided style. Experiments show that brainSPADE synthetic data can be used to train segmentation models with performance comparable to that of models trained on real data.",,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science,Simulation and Synthesis in Medical Imaging,,2022-09-21,2022,2022-09-21,2022,13570,,79-90,All OA, Green,Chapter,"Fernandez, Virginia; Pinaya, Walter Hugo Lopez; Borges, Pedro; Tudosiu, Petru-Daniel; Graham, Mark S.; Vercauteren, Tom; Cardoso, M.

accuracy on benchmark datasets where training and test sets are from the same
domain, yet their performance can degrade significantly on unseen domains,
which hinders the deployment of CNNs in many clinical scenarios. Most existing
works improve model out-of-domain (OOD) robustness by collecting multi-domain
datasets for training, which is expensive and may not always be feasible due to
privacy and logistical issues. In this work, we focus on improving model
robustness using a single-domain dataset only. We propose a novel data
augmentation framework called MaxStyle, which maximizes the effectiveness of
style augmentation for model OOD performance. It attaches an auxiliary
style-augmented image decoder to a segmentation network for robust feature
learning and data augmentation. Importantly, MaxStyle augments data with
improved image style diversity and hardness, by expanding the style space with
noise and searching for the worst-case style composition of latent features via
adversarial training. With extensive experiments on multiple public cardiac and
prostate MR datasets, we demonstrate that MaxStyle leads to significantly
improved out-of-distribution robustness against unseen corruptions as well as
common distribution shifts across multiple, different, unseen sites and unknown
image sequences under both low- and high-training data settings. The code can

studied for many decades. Deep learning-based supervised segmentation models
have achieved state-of-the-art performance but most of them are limited by
using pixel-wise loss functions for training without geometrical constraints.
Inspired by Euler's Elastica model and recent active contour models introduced
into the field of deep learning, we propose a novel active contour with
elastica (ACE) loss function incorporating Elastica (curvature and length) and
region information as geometrically-natural constraints for the image
segmentation tasks. We introduce the mean curvature i.e. the average of all
principal curvatures, as a more effective image prior to representing curvature
in our ACE loss function. Furthermore, based on the definition of the mean
curvature, we propose a fast solution to approximate the ACE loss in
three-dimensional (3D) by using Laplace operators for 3D image segmentation. We
evaluate our ACE loss function on four 2D and 3D natural and biomedical image
datasets. Our results show that the proposed loss function outperforms other
mainstream loss functions on different segmentation networks. Our source code

of interest (ROIs). However, they always cover a diverse set of structures,
causing difficulties for the segmentation model to learn good decision
boundaries with high sensitivity and precision. The issue concerns the highly
heterogeneous nature of the background class, resulting in multi-modal
distributions. Empirically, we find that neural networks trained with
heterogeneous background struggle to map the corresponding contextual samples
to compact clusters in feature space. As a result, the distribution over
background logit activations may shift across the decision boundary, leading to
systematic over-segmentation across different datasets and tasks. In this
study, we propose context label learning (CoLab) to improve the context
representations by decomposing the background class into several subclasses.
Specifically, we train an auxiliary network as a task generator, along with the
primary segmentation model, to automatically generate context labels that
positively affect the ROI segmentation accuracy. Extensive experiments are
conducted on several challenging segmentation tasks and datasets. The results
demonstrate that CoLab can guide the segmentation model to map the logits of
background samples away from the decision boundary, resulting in significantly
improved segmentation accuracy.

become imperative to generate trust in their use for day-to-day tasks. Although
many works have addressed this problem by generating visual explanation maps,
they often provide noisy and inaccurate results forcing the use of heuristic
regularization unrelated to the classifier in question. In this paper, we
propose a new general perspective of the visual explanation problem overcoming
these limitations. We show that visual explanation can be produced as the
difference between two generated images obtained via two specific conditional
generative models. Both generative models are trained using the classifier to
explain and a database to enforce the following properties: (i) All images
generated by the first generator are classified similarly to the input image,
whereas the second generator's outputs are classified oppositely. (ii)
Generated images belong to the distribution of real images. (iii) The distances
between the input image and the corresponding generated images are minimal so
that the difference between the generated elements only reveals relevant
information for the studied classifier. Using symmetrical and cyclic
constraints, we present two different approximations and implementations of the
general formulation. Experimentally, we demonstrate significant improvements

However, small organ segmentation (e.g., pancreas) is still a challenging task. To tackle such problems, extracting and aggregating multi-scale robust features become essentially important. In this paper, we develop a multi-level structural loss by integrating the region, boundary, and pixel-wise information to supervise feature fusion and precise segmentation. The novel pixel-wise term can provide information complementary to the region and boundary loss, which helps to discover more local information from the image. We further develop a multi-branch network with a saliency guidance module to better aggregate the three levels of features. The coarse-to-fine segmentation architecture is adopted to use the prediction on the coarse stage to obtain the bounding box for the fine stage. Comprehensive evaluations are performed on three benchmark datasets, i.e., the NIH pancreas, ISICDM pancreas, and MSD spleen dataset, showing that our models can achieve significant increases in segmentation accuracy compared to several state-of-the-art pancreas and spleen segmentation methods.

One of these forms is the presence of low probability, but unsurprising, tissue abnormalities as a result of e.g. implants and surgery. Assessments from automated methods can be impeded if the ML system cannot address these abnormalities. A context where this issue arises is segmentation of lesions within the liver when postoperative scans are possible inputs to the model, since surgical clips and postoperative seromas can distort measures such as future liver remnant volume if they are not correctly identified. To this end, we developed a deep learning segmentation model with classes that expliciltly include surgery-related structures: liver parenchyma, lesions, surgical clips, and postoperative seromas. Given a heavy class imbalance in this task, we deployed an asymmetric focal loss function and hysteresis thresholding post-processing. We applied our model to T1-weighted MRI data, reporting average Dice scores of 0.96, 0.57, 0.71, and 0.84 for the four classes, respectively. Finally, we tested the model’s potential in a semi-automatic workflow, finding a user-interaction speedup and an increased inter-rater agreement compared to fully manual delineations.

task involving multiple MRI imaging modalities that can assist clinicians in
diagnosing the patient and successively studying the progression of the
malignant entity. In recent years, Fully Convolutional Neural Networks (FCNNs)
approaches have become the de facto standard for 3D medical image segmentation.
The popular ""U-shaped"" network architecture has achieved state-of-the-art
performance benchmarks on different 2D and 3D semantic segmentation tasks and
across various imaging modalities. However, due to the limited kernel size of
convolution layers in FCNNs, their performance of modeling long-range
information is sub-optimal, and this can lead to deficiencies in the
segmentation of tumors with variable sizes. On the other hand, transformer
models have demonstrated excellent capabilities in capturing such long-range
information in multiple domains, including natural language processing and
computer vision. Inspired by the success of vision transformers and their
variants, we propose a novel segmentation model termed Swin UNEt TRansformers
(Swin UNETR). Specifically, the task of 3D brain tumor semantic segmentation is
reformulated as a sequence to sequence prediction problem wherein multi-modal
input data is projected into a 1D sequence of embedding and used as an input to
a hierarchical Swin transformer as the encoder. The swin transformer encoder
extracts features at five different resolutions by utilizing shifted windows
for computing self-attention and is connected to an FCNN-based decoder at each
resolution via skip connections. We have participated in BraTS 2021
segmentation challenge, and our proposed model ranks among the top-performing
approaches in the validation phase.

comprehensively compared medical image registration approaches on a wide range

comprehensive characterisation of deformable registration algorithms. A
continuous evaluation will be possible at

anatomies (brain, abdomen, and thorax), modalities (ultrasound, CT, MR),
availability of annotations, as well as intra- and inter-patient registration
evaluation. We established an easily accessible framework for training and
validation of 3D registration methods, which enabled the compilation of results
of over 65 individual method submissions from more than 20 unique teams. We
used a complementary set of metrics, including robustness, accuracy,

to their ability to model long-range dependencies. However, the self-attention
mechanism, which is the core part of the Transformer model, usually suffers
from quadratic computational complexity with respect to the number of tokens.
Many architectures attempt to reduce model complexity by limiting the
self-attention mechanism to local regions or by redesigning the tokenization
process. In this paper, we propose DAE-Former, a novel method that seeks to
provide an alternative perspective by efficiently designing the self-attention
mechanism. More specifically, we reformulate the self-attention mechanism to
capture both spatial and channel relations across the whole feature dimension
while staying computationally efficient. Furthermore, we redesign the skip
connection path by including the cross-attention module to ensure the feature
reusability and enhance the localization power. Our method outperforms

large quantities to achieve a good performance. In the medical domain, such
annotations are expensive, because they are time-consuming and require expert
knowledge. Active learning optimizes the annotation effort by devising
strategies to select cases for labeling that are most informative to the model.
In this work, we propose an uncertainty slice sampling (USS) strategy for
semantic segmentation of 3D medical volumes that selects 2D image slices for
annotation and compare it with various other strategies. We demonstrate the
efficiency of USS on a CT liver segmentation task using multi-site data. After
five iterations, the training data resulting from USS consisted of 2410 slices
(4% of all slices in the data pool) compared to 8121 (13%), 8641 (14%), and
3730 (6%) for uncertainty volume (UVS), random volume (RVS), and random slice
(RSS) sampling, respectively. Despite being trained on the smallest amount of
data, the model based on the USS strategy evaluated on 234 test volumes
significantly outperformed models trained according to other strategies and
achieved a mean Dice index of 0.964, a relative volume error of 4.2%, a mean
surface distance of 1.35 mm, and a Hausdorff distance of 23.4 mm. This was only
slightly inferior to 0.967, 3.8%, 1.18 mm, and 22.9 mm achieved by a model
trained on all available data, but the robustness analysis using the 5th
percentile of Dice and the 95th percentile of the remaining metrics
demonstrated that USS resulted not only in the most robust model compared to
other sampling schemes, but also outperformed the model trained on all data

Transformers to effectively capture long-term dependencies in its inputs. The
FCT is the first fully convolutional Transformer model in medical imaging

extract long range semantic dependencies from the input image, and then learns
to capture hierarchical global attributes from the features. FCT is compact,
accurate and robust. Our results show that it outperforms all existing
transformer architectures by large margins across multiple medical image
segmentation datasets of varying data modalities without the need for any
pre-training. FCT outperforms its immediate competitor on the ACDC dataset by

Materials and Methods A deep learning model for the two most common disease sites of high grade serous ovarian cancer lesions (pelvis/ovaries and omentum) was developed and compared against the well-established “no-new-Net” (nnU-Net) framework and unrevised trainee radiologist segmentations. A total of 451 pre-treatment and post neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) CT scans collected from four different institutions were used for training (n=276), hyper-parameter tuning (n=104) and testing (n=71) of the methods. The performance was evaluated using the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and compared using a Wilcoxon test on paired results   Results Our model outperforms the nnU-Net framework by a significant margin for both disease (validation: p=1×10-4,1.5×10-6, test: p=0.004, 0.005) and it does not perform significantly different from a trainee radiologist for the pelvic/ovarian lesions (p=0.392). On an independent test set (n=71), the model achieves a performance of 72±19 mean DSC for the pelvic/ovarian and 64±24 for the omental lesions.   Conclusion Automated ovarian cancer segmentation on CT using deep neural networks is feasible and achieves performance close to a trainee-level radiologist for pelvic/ovarian lesions.   Summary Deep learning-based models were used to assess whether fully automated segmentation is feasible for the main two disease sites in high grade serous ovarian cancer.   Key Points   First automated approach for pelvic/ovarian and omental ovarian cancer lesion segmentation on CT images.   Automated segmentation of ovarian cancer lesions can be comparable with manual segmentation of trainee radiologists with three years of experience in oncological and gynecological imaging.   Careful hyper-parameter tuning can provide models significantly outperforming strong state-of-the-art baselines.","The authors would like to thank Fabian Isensee for both making the nnU-Net library freely available and easy to use for new datasets.

Popular registration tools such as ANTs and NiftyReg optimize an objective function for each pair of images from scratch which is time-consuming for large images with complicated deformation. Facilitated by the rapid progress of deep learning, learning-based approaches such as VoxelMorph have been emerging for image registration. These approaches can achieve competitive performance in a fraction of a second on advanced GPUs. In this work, we construct a neural registration framework, called NeurReg, with a hybrid loss of displacement fields and data similarity, which substantially improves the current state-of-the-art of registrations. Within the framework, we simulate various transformations by a registration simulator which generates fixed image and displacement field ground truth for training. Furthermore, we design three segmentation frameworks based on the proposed registration framework: 1) atlas-based segmentation, 2) joint learning of both segmentation and registration tasks, and 3) multi-task learning with atlas-based segmentation as an intermediate feature. Extensive experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed NeurReg framework based on various metrics: the endpoint error (EPE) of the predicted displacement field, mean square error (MSE), normalized local cross-correlation (NLCC), mutual information (MI), Dice coefficient, uncertainty estimation, and the interpretability of the segmentation.

637,pub.1155160425,10.1109/wacv56688.2023.00365,,,The Fully Convolutional Transformer for Medical Image Segmentation,"We propose a novel transformer, capable of segmenting medical images of varying modalities. Challenges posed by the fine-grained nature of medical image analysis mean that the adaptation of the transformer for their analysis is still at nascent stages. The overwhelming success of the UNet lay in its ability to appreciate the fine-grained nature of the segmentation task, an ability which existing transformer based models do not currently posses. To address this shortcoming, we propose The Fully Convolutional Transformer (FCT), which builds on the proven ability of Convolutional Neural Networks to learn effective image representations, and combines them with the ability of Transformers to effectively capture long-term dependencies in its inputs. The FCT is the first fully convolutional Transformer model in medical imaging literature. It processes its input in two stages, where first, it learns to extract long range semantic dependencies from the input image, and then learns to capture hierarchical global attributes from the features. FCT is compact, accurate and robust. Our results show that it outperforms all existing transformer architectures by large margins across multiple medical image segmentation datasets of varying data modalities without the need for any pre-training. FCT outperforms its immediate competitor on the ACDC dataset by 1.3%, on the Synapse dataset by 4.4%, on the Spleen dataset by 1.2% and on ISIC 2017 dataset by 1.1% on the dice metric, with up to five times fewer parameters. On the ACDC Post-2017-MICCAI-Challenge online test set, our model sets a new state-of-the-art on unseen MRI test cases out-performing large ensemble models as well as nnUNet with considerably fewer parameters.

The neurosurgeons typically uses 2-D MRI images for preoperative planning and execution of surgery. The determination of the size of the tumor and its exact location is of utmost necessity for planning the safe surgery so that the normal brain tissues should not be harmed. If this information is available before the surgery, the problems could be minimized. 3-D printing of tumors extracted from medical images also had an inbuilt problem of STL error. The surface models obtained from the software are not 3-D printing ready and have multiple errors such as holes, the inverted orientation of triangles, shells, and border edges. Because of such errors in the STL mesh, faulty or erroneous 3-D printed parts get produced. If such parts are used by the neurosurgeons for preoperative planning of surgery the normal healthy tissues of the brain could permanently get damaged and will harm the normal functioning of the patient and in the worst-case scenario could be life-threatening to the patient. To avoid such problems an attempt has been made in the present study. Medical imaging (MRI) datasets of brain tumors are used to create 3-D printed brain tumors. For extracting the tumor from images an open-source software, 3-D slicer has been used. The surface models directly obtained from the 3-D slicer are then optimized for errors in Autodesk NetFabb software. The surface models before and after optimization are 3-D printed using Makerbot Replicator 3-D printer and are compared. The comparison showed that the physical models directly printed from the surface models obtained from 3-D slicer are missing important information regarding tumor exact size and shape. The optimized surface models obtained from Autodesk Netfabb are having refined mesh with STL errors minimized and thus the physical models printed from these surface models are more accurate and are preserving the exact shape and size of the tumor.","This paper is a revised and expanded version of an article entitled, ‘‘Error minimization in pre-surgical model of brain tumor for 3-D printing’’ presented in ‘Recent Advances in Materials, Manufacturing and Machine Learning (RAMMML-2022)’ Conference, held at ‘Yeshwantrao Chavan College of Engineering’, Nagpur, India, during April 26–27, 2022.",The authors have not disclosed any funding.,Journal of The Institution of Engineers (India): Series C,,,2022-11-15,2022,2022-11-15,2023-02,104,1,101-111,Closed,Article,"Mahatme, Chetan; Giri, Jayant","Mahatme, Chetan (Yeshwantrao Chavan College of Engineering, 441110, Nagpur, India); Giri, Jayant (Yeshwantrao Chavan College of Engineering, 441110, Nagpur, India)","Mahatme, Chetan (Rashtrasant Tukadoji Maharaj Nagpur University)","Mahatme, Chetan (Rashtrasant Tukadoji Maharaj Nagpur University); Giri, Jayant (Rashtrasant Tukadoji Maharaj Nagpur University)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1152757518,40 Engineering, 4017 Mechanical Engineering,,,,,,,,,,,

detecting, segmenting and tracking of medical instruments based on endoscopic
video images have been proposed in the literature, key limitations remain to be
addressed: Firstly, robustness, that is, the reliable performance of
state-of-the-art methods when run on challenging images (e.g. in the presence
of blood, smoke or motion artifacts). Secondly, generalization; algorithms
trained for a specific intervention in a specific hospital should generalize to
other interventions or institutions.
  In an effort to promote solutions for these limitations, we organized the
Robust Medical Instrument Segmentation (ROBUST-MIS) challenge as an
international benchmarking competition with a specific focus on the robustness
and generalization capabilities of algorithms. For the first time in the field
of endoscopic image processing, our challenge included a task on binary
segmentation and also addressed multi-instance detection and segmentation. The
challenge was based on a surgical data set comprising 10,040 annotated images
acquired from a total of 30 surgical procedures from three different types of
surgery. The validation of the competing methods for the three tasks (binary
segmentation, multi-instance detection and multi-instance segmentation) was
performed in three different stages with an increasing domain gap between the
training and the test data. The results confirm the initial hypothesis, namely
that algorithm performance degrades with an increasing domain gap. While the
average detection and segmentation quality of the best-performing algorithms is
high, future research should concentrate on detection and segmentation of
small, crossing, moving and transparent instrument(s) (parts).",,,arXiv,,,2020-03-23,2020,,,,,,All OA, Green,Preprint,"Ross, Tobias; Reinke, Annika; Full, Peter M.; Wagner, Martin; Kenngott, Hannes; Apitz, Martin; Hempe, Hellena; Filimon, Diana Mindroc; Scholz, Patrick; Tran, Thuy Nuong; Bruno, Pierangela; Arbeláez, Pablo; Bian, Gui-Bin; Bodenstedt, Sebastian; Bolmgren, Jon Lindström; Bravo-Sánchez, Laura; Chen, Hua-Bin; González, Cristina; Guo, Dong; Halvorsen, Pål; Heng, Pheng-Ann; Hosgor, Enes; Hou, Zeng-Guang; Isensee, Fabian; Jha, Debesh; Jiang, Tingting; Jin, Yueming; Kirtac, Kadir; Kletz, Sabrina; Leger, Stefan; Li, Zhixuan; Maier-Hein, Klaus H.; Ni, Zhen-Liang; Riegler, Michael A.; Schoeffmann, Klaus; Shi, Ruohua; Speidel, Stefanie; Stenzel, Michael; Twick, Isabell; Wang, Gutai; Wang, Jiacheng; Wang, Liansheng; Wang, Lu; Zhang, Yujie; Zhou, Yan-Jie; Zhu, Lei; Wiesenfarth, Manuel; Kopp-Schneider, Annette; Müller-Stich, Beat P.; Maier-Hein, Lena","Ross, Tobias (); Reinke, Annika (); Full, Peter M.

617,pub.1144479822,10.1109/access.2022.3141021,,,Robust Segmentation Models Using an Uncertainty Slice Sampling-Based Annotation Workflow,"Semantic segmentation neural networks require pixel-level annotations in large quantities to achieve a good performance. In the medical domain, such annotations are expensive because they are time-consuming and require expert knowledge. Active learning optimizes the annotation effort by devising strategies to select cases for labeling that are the most informative to the model. In this work, we propose an uncertainty slice sampling (USS) strategy for the semantic segmentation of 3D medical volumes that selects 2D image slices for annotation and we compare it with various other strategies. We demonstrate the efficiency of USS on a CT liver segmentation task using multisite data. After five iterations, the training data resulting from USS consisted of 2410 slices (4% of all slices in the data pool) compared to 8121(13%), 8641(14%), and 3730(6%) slices for uncertainty volume (UVS), random volume (RVS), and random slice (RSS) sampling, respectively. Despite being trained on the smallest amount of data, the model based on the USS strategy evaluated on 234 test volumes significantly outperformed models trained according to the UVS, RVS, and RSS strategies and achieved a mean Dice index of 0.964, a relative volume error of 4.2%, a mean surface distance of 1.35mm, and a Hausdorff distance of 23.4mm. This was only slightly inferior to 0.967, 3.8%, 1.18mm, and 22.9mm achieved by a model trained on all available data. Our robustness analysis using the 5th percentile of Dice and the 95th percentile of the remaining metrics demonstrated that USS not only resulted in the most robust model compared to other strategies, but also outperformed the model trained on all data according to the 5th percentile of Dice (0.946 vs. 0.945) and the 95th percentile of mean surface distance (1.92mm vs. 2.03mm).","This work was supported by the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft.

Previously, excellent automatic segmentation results were achieved on datasets of standardised MRI images acquired for stereotactic surgery planning. However, diagnostic clinical datasets are generally more diverse and pose a larger challenge to automatic segmentation algorithms. Here, we show that automatic segmentation of VS on such datasets is also possible with high accuracy.   Methods We acquired a large multi-centre routine clinical (MC-RC) dataset of 168 patients with a single sporadic VS who were referred from 10 medical sites and consecutively seen at a single centre. Up to three longitudinal MRI exams were selected for each patient. Selection rules based on image modality, resolution orientation, and acquisition timepoint were defined to automatically select contrast-enhanced T1-weighted (ceT1w) images (n=130) and T2-weighted images (n=379). Manual ground truth segmentations were obtained in an iterative process in which segmentations were: 1) produced or amended by a specialized company; and 2) reviewed by one of three trained radiologists; and 3) validated by an expert team. Inter- and intra-observer reliability was assessed on a subset of 10 ceT1w and 41 T2w images. The MC-RC dataset was split randomly into 3 nonoverlapping sets for model training, hyperparameter-tuning and testing in proportions 70/10/20%. We applied deep learning to train our VS segmentation model, based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) within the nnU-Net framework.   Results Our model achieved excellent Dice scores when evaluated on the MC-RC testing set as well as the public testing set. On the MC-RC testing set, Dice scores were 90.8±4.5% for ceT1w, 86.1±11.6% for T2w and 82.3±18.4% for a combined ceT1w+T2w input.   Conclusions We developed a model for automatic VS segmentation on diverse multi-centre clinical datasets. The results show that the performance of the framework is comparable to that of human annotators. In contrast, a model trained a publicly available dataset acquired for Gamma Knife stereotactic radiosurgery did not perform well on the MC-RC testing set. The application of our model has the potential to greatly facilitate the management of patients in clinical practice. Our pre-trained segmentation models are made available online. Moreover, we are in the process of making the MC-RC dataset publicly available.",The authors would like to thank Dr Andrew Worth and Gregory Millington for their contributions to the generation of the segmentation ground truth.,"This work was supported by Wellcome Trust (203145Z/16/Z, 203148/Z/16/Z, WT106882), EPSRC (NS/A000050/1, NS/A000049/1) and MRC (MC/PC/180520) funding.

these techniques in medical image segmentation, especially in conjunction with
the U-Net model (or its variants), which has shown great success in medical
image segmentation, under both 2D and 3D settings. Current 2D based methods
either directly replace convolutional layers with pure transformers or consider
a transformer as an additional intermediate encoder between the encoder and
decoder of U-Net. However, these approaches only consider the attention
encoding within one single slice and do not utilize the axial-axis information
naturally provided by a 3D volume. In the 3D setting, convolution on volumetric

downsample the image or use cropped local patches to reduce GPU memory usage,
which limits its performance. In this paper, we propose Axial Fusion
Transformer UNet (AFTer-UNet), which takes both advantages of convolutional
layers' capability of extracting detailed features and transformers' strength
on long sequence modeling. It considers both intra-slice and inter-slice

Precise delineations of abdominal organs boundaries reveal fundamental for a variety of purposes: surgical planning, volumetric estimation (e.g. Total Kidney Volume – TKV – assessment in Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease – ADPKD), diagnosis and monitoring of pathologies. Fundamental imaging techniques exploited for these tasks are Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), which enable clinicians to perform 3D analyses of all Regions of Interests (ROIs). In the realm of existing methods for segmentation and classification of these zones, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are emerging as the reference approach.

The high accuracy provided by those systems cannot be denied as motivation of all obtained results, though there are still problems to be addressed with. In this survey, major article databases, as Scopus, for instance, were systematically investigated for different kinds of Deep Learning approaches in segmentation of abdominal organs with a particular focus on liver, kidney and spleen.

Tackling the disease by providing the necessary resources to the affected is of
paramount importance. However, estimation of the required resources is not a
trivial task given the number of factors which determine the requirement. This
issue can be addressed by predicting the probability that an infected patient
requires Intensive Care Unit (ICU) support and the importance of each of the
factors that influence it. Moreover, to assist the doctors in determining the
patients at high risk of fatality, the probability of death is also calculated.
For determining both the patient outcomes (ICU admission and death), a novel
methodology is proposed by combining multi-modal features, extracted from
Computed Tomography (CT) scans and Electronic Health Record (EHR) data. Deep
learning models are leveraged to extract quantitative features from CT scans.
These features combined with those directly read from the EHR database are fed
into machine learning models to eventually output the probabilities of patient
outcomes. This work demonstrates both the ability to apply a broad set of deep
learning methods for general quantification of Chest CT scans and the ability
to link these quantitative metrics to patient outcomes. The effectiveness of
the proposed method is shown by testing it on an internally curated dataset,
achieving a mean area under Receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of
0.77 on ICU admission prediction and a mean AUC of 0.73 on death prediction

Semi-supervised learning has been widely applied to medical image segmentation tasks since it alleviates the heavy burden of acquiring expert-examined annotations and takes the advantage of unlabeled data which is much easier to acquire. Although consistency learning has been proven to be an effective approach by enforcing an invariance of predictions under different distributions, existing approaches cannot make full use of region-level shape constraint and boundary-level distance information from unlabeled data. In this paper, we propose a novel uncertainty-guided mutual consistency learning framework to effectively exploit unlabeled data by integrating intra-task consistency learning from up-to-date predictions for self-ensembling and cross-task consistency learning from task-level regularization to exploit geometric shape information.

Current medical image reconstruction algorithms mainly run on Si-based digital processors with von Neumann architecture, which faces critical challenges to process massive amount of data for high-speed and high-quality imaging. Here, we present a memristive image reconstructor (MIR) to greatly accelerate image reconstruction with discrete Fourier transformation (DFT) by computing-in-memory (CIM) with memristor. To implement DFT on memristor arrays efficiently, we proposed a high-accuracy quasi-analogue mapping (QAM) method and generic complex matrix transfer (CMT) scheme, to improve the mapping precision and transfer efficiency, respectively. With these two strategies, we used MIR to demonstrate high-fidelity magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) image reconstructions, achieving software-equivalent qualities with peak signal-to-noise ratios (PSNR) of 40.88 dB and 22.38 dB, respectively. The reconstructed images were then segmented using a popular nnU-Net algorithm to further evaluate the reconstruction quality. For the MRI task, the final DICE scores were 0.979 and 0.980 for MIR and software, respectively; while for the CT task, the DICE scores were 0.977 and 0.985 for MIR and software, respectively. These results validated the feasibility of using memristor-reconstructed images for medical diagnosis. Furthermore, our MIR also exhibited more than 153× and 79× improvements in energy efficiency and normalized image reconstruction speed, respectively, compared to graphics processing unit (GPU). This work demonstrates MIR as a promising platform for high-fidelity image reconstruction for future medical diagnosis, and also largely extends the application of memristor-based CIM beyond artificial neural networks.",,,Research Square,,,2022-10-27,2022,2022-10-27,,,,,All OA, Green,Preprint,"Zhao, Han; Liu, Zhengwu; Tang, Jianshi; Gao, Bin; Qin, Qi; Li, Jiaming; Zhou, Ying; Yao, Peng; Xi, Yue; Lin, Yudeng; Qian, He; Wu, Huaqiang","Zhao, Han (Tsinghua University); Liu, Zhengwu (Tsinghua University); Tang, Jianshi (Tsinghua University); Gao, Bin (Tsinghua University); Qin, Qi (); Li, Jiaming (Tsinghua University); Zhou, Ying (Tsinghua University); Yao, Peng (Tsinghua University); Xi, Yue (Tsinghua University); Lin, Yudeng (Tsinghua University); Qian, He (Tsinghua University); Wu, Huaqiang (Tsinghua University)",,"Zhao, Han (Tsinghua University); Liu, Zhengwu (Tsinghua University); Tang, Jianshi (Tsinghua University); Gao, Bin (Tsinghua University); Qin, Qi (); Li, Jiaming (Tsinghua University); Zhou, Ying (Tsinghua University); Yao, Peng (Tsinghua University); Xi, Yue (Tsinghua University); Lin, Yudeng (Tsinghua University); Qian, He (Tsinghua University); Wu, Huaqiang (Tsinghua University)",0,0,,,https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-2147455/latest.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1152268495,46 Information and Computing Sciences, 4603 Computer Vision and Multimedia Computation,7 Affordable and Clean Energy,,,,,,,,,

However, large position changes, high variability in shape and size, and the extremely blurred boundary make the task of pancreas segmentation challenging. To alleviate these challenges, we propose the residual transformer UNet (RTUNet) to fit the nature of the pancreas. Specifically, a residual transformer block is implemented to extract multi-scale features from a global perspective which captures high variabilities in the pancreas position. In addition, a dual convolutional down-sampling strategy is leveraged to obtain precise shape and size features of the pancreas in a large receptive field which prevents the loss of information. We finally propose a dice hausdorff distance loss that makes the network focus on the pancreas boundary. Through extensive experiments on the public NIH dataset, we achieved a dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 86.25%, which outperforms the state-of-the-art DSC of 85.49%.

clinical approaches. Semi-supervised learning has been widely applied to
medical image segmentation tasks since it alleviates the heavy burden of
acquiring expert-examined annotations and takes the advantage of unlabeled data
which is much easier to acquire. Although consistency learning has been proven
to be an effective approach by enforcing an invariance of predictions under
different distributions, existing approaches cannot make full use of
region-level shape constraint and boundary-level distance information from
unlabeled data. In this paper, we propose a novel uncertainty-guided mutual
consistency learning framework to effectively exploit unlabeled data by
integrating intra-task consistency learning from up-to-date predictions for
self-ensembling and cross-task consistency learning from task-level
regularization to exploit geometric shape information. The framework is guided
by the estimated segmentation uncertainty of models to select out relatively
certain predictions for consistency learning, so as to effectively exploit more

learning without sharing data across different data owners, which helps address
the concern of data privacy in medical image analysis. However, the requirement
for label consistency across clients by the existing methods largely narrows
its application scope. In practice, each clinical site may only annotate
certain organs of interest with partial or no overlap with other sites.
Incorporating such partially labeled data into a unified federation is an
unexplored problem with clinical significance and urgency. This work tackles
the challenge by using a novel federated multi-encoding U-Net (Fed-MENU) method
for multi-organ segmentation. In our method, a multi-encoding U-Net (MENU-Net)
is proposed to extract organ-specific features through different encoding
sub-networks. Each sub-network can be seen as an expert of a specific organ and
trained for that client. Moreover, to encourage the organ-specific features
extracted by different sub-networks to be informative and distinctive, we
regularize the training of the MENU-Net by designing an auxiliary generic
decoder (AGD). Extensive experiments on four public datasets show that our
Fed-MENU method can effectively obtain a federated learning model using the
partially labeled datasets with superior performance to other models trained by
either localized or centralized learning methods. Source code will be made

Despite the success of convolutional neural networks (CNN) in automatic pancreas segmentation, the loss of the shape features impedes progress in clinical applications. Therefore, a novel pancreas segmentation network is proposed to extract features in a propagation and fusion manner, named FPF-Net. Firstly, the low-level features and high-level features are combined progressively to preserve and propagate the shape features of the pancreas. Secondly, instead of context-unaware addition or concatenation, we adopt attentional feature fusion (AFF) to alleviate the problems caused by the shape diversity and small size of the pancreas. Finally, a module consisting of Coordinate and multi-scale spatial attention (CMSA) is designed to exploit long-range dependencies and multi-scale spatial features. This module is used to extract salient information for pancreas segmentation. Experimental results validated on two pancreas datasets and a spleen dataset justify the superiority and generalization ability of our method and guarantee the reliability of our approach in clinical application.","This research is supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2018YFB0804202, 2018YFB0804203), Regional Joint Fund of NSFC (U19A2057), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (61876070), Jilin University “Interdisciplinary Integration and Innovation” Young Scholars Free Exploration Project (JLUXKJC2021QZ01), Jilin Province Science and Technology Development Plan Project (20190303134SF), Anhui University Collaborative Innovation Project Subproject (GXXT-2021-008).",,Multimedia Systems,,,2022-06-26,2022,2022-06-26,2023-04,29,2,525-538,Closed,Article,"Chen, Haipeng; Liu, Yunjie; Shi, Zenan","Chen, Haipeng (College of Computer Science and Technology, Jilin University, 130012, Changchun, China; Key Laboratory of Symbolic Computation and Knowledge Engineering of Ministry of Education, Jilin University, 130012, Changchun, China); Liu, Yunjie (College of Computer Science and Technology, Jilin University, 130012, Changchun, China; Key Laboratory of Symbolic Computation and Knowledge Engineering of Ministry of Education, Jilin University, 130012, Changchun, China); Shi, Zenan (College of Computer Science and Technology, Jilin University, 130012, Changchun, China; Key Laboratory of Symbolic Computation and Knowledge Engineering of Ministry of Education, Jilin University, 130012, Changchun, China)","Shi, Zenan (Jilin University; Jilin University)","Chen, Haipeng (Jilin University; Jilin University); Liu, Yunjie (Jilin University; Jilin University); Shi, Zenan (Jilin University; Jilin University)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1148981827,46 Information and Computing Sciences, 4605 Data Management and Data Science,,,,,,,,,,,

learning in medical image analysis. Deep convolutional neural nets (CNNs) have
shown great promise in achieving clinically applicable image segmentation
performance on CT or MRI images. State-of-the-art CNN segmentation models apply
either 2D or 3D convolutions on input images, with pros and cons associated
with each method: 2D convolution is fast, less memory-intensive but inadequate
for extracting 3D contextual information from volumetric images, while the
opposite is true for 3D convolution. To fit a 3D CNN model on CT or MRI images
on commodity GPUs, one usually has to either downsample input images or use
cropped local regions as inputs, which limits the utility of 3D models for
multi-organ segmentation. In this work, we propose a new framework for
combining 3D and 2D models, in which the segmentation is realized through
high-resolution 2D convolutions, but guided by spatial contextual information
extracted from a low-resolution 3D model. We implement a self-attention
mechanism to control which 3D features should be used to guide 2D segmentation.
Our model is light on memory usage but fully equipped to take 3D contextual
information into account. Experiments on multiple organ segmentation datasets
demonstrate that by taking advantage of both 2D and 3D models, our method is

segmentation relies overwhelmingly on a myriad amount of densely annotated
training data, which, however, are difficult to obtain due to the tremendous
labor and expertise required, particularly for annotating 3D medical images.
Although self-supervised learning (SSL) has shown great potential to address
this issue, most SSL approaches focus only on image-level global consistency,
but ignore the local consistency which plays a pivotal role in capturing
structural information for dense prediction tasks such as segmentation. In this
paper, we propose a PriorGuided Local (PGL) self-supervised model that learns
the region-wise local consistency in the latent feature space. Specifically, we
use the spatial transformations, which produce different augmented views of the
same image, as a prior to deduce the location relation between two views, which
is then used to align the feature maps of the same local region but being
extracted on two views. Next, we construct a local consistency loss to minimize
the voxel-wise discrepancy between the aligned feature maps. Thus, our PGL
model learns the distinctive representations of local regions, and hence is
able to retain structural information. This ability is conducive to downstream
segmentation tasks. We conducted an extensive evaluation on four public
computerized tomography (CT) datasets that cover 11 kinds of major human organs
and two tumors. The results indicate that using pre-trained PGL model to
initialize a downstream network leads to a substantial performance improvement
over both random initialization and the initialization with global

This article addresses a new framework based on Attention U-Net (ATT U-Net) network and graph-based Random Walk (RW) to extract both nucleus and cytoplasm of each individual cell within an image of overlapping cervical cells. The proposed approach starts by separating nuclei from the cellular clumps through ATT U-Net architecture. Then, we remove fake nuclei that are usually much smaller than real nuclei. For each nucleus, a polar coordinate sampling matrix is generated. Each element in this matrix is realized by converting the image pixel from Cartesian coordinates to polar coordinates. After that, converted images would serve as the input of ATT U-Net for predicting cytoplasm. And finally, Graph-based RW is applied to extract the contour of cytoplasm. Because the features of cytoplasm boundaries in predicted maps are so obvious that the segmentation of every individual cell, including overlapping area, worked well under RW.

KErnel Shrinking (CAKES), to enable efficient 3D learning by shrinking standard
3D convolutions into a set of economic operations e.g., 1D, 2D convolutions.
Unlike previous methods, CAKES performs channel-wise kernel shrinkage, which
enjoys the following benefits: 1) enabling operations deployed in every layer
to be heterogeneous, so that they can extract diverse and complementary
information to benefit the learning process; and 2) allowing for an efficient
and flexible replacement design, which can be generalized to both
spatial-temporal and volumetric data. Further, we propose a new search space
based on CAKES, so that the replacement configuration can be determined
automatically for simplifying 3D networks. CAKES shows superior performance to
other methods with similar model size, and it also achieves comparable
performance to state-of-the-art with much fewer parameters and computational
costs on tasks including 3D medical imaging segmentation and video action
recognition. Codes and models are available at

trained on one source domain do not generalize well to other unseen domains. In
this work, we investigate the single-source domain generalization problem:
training a deep network that is robust to unseen domains, under the condition
that training data is only available from one source domain, which is common in
medical imaging applications. We tackle this problem in the context of
cross-domain medical image segmentation. Under this scenario, domain shifts are
mainly caused by different acquisition processes. We propose a simple
causality-inspired data augmentation approach to expose a segmentation model to
synthesized domain-shifted training examples. Specifically, 1) to make the deep
model robust to discrepancies in image intensities and textures, we employ a
family of randomly-weighted shallow networks. They augment training images
using diverse appearance transformations. 2) Further we show that spurious
correlations among objects in an image are detrimental to domain robustness.
These correlations might be taken by the network as domain-specific clues for
making predictions, and they may break on unseen domains. We remove these
spurious correlations via causal intervention. This is achieved by resampling
the appearances of potentially correlated objects independently. The proposed
approach is validated on three cross-domain segmentation tasks: cross-modality
(CT-MRI) abdominal image segmentation, cross-sequence (bSSFP-LGE) cardiac MRI
segmentation, and cross-center prostate MRI segmentation. The proposed approach
yields consistent performance gains compared with competitive methods when
tested on unseen domains.",,,arXiv,,,2021-11-24,2021,,,,,,All OA, Green,Preprint,"Ouyang, Cheng; Chen, Chen; Li, Surui; Li, Zeju; Qin, Chen; Bai, Wenjia; Rueckert, Daniel","Ouyang, Cheng (); Chen, Chen (); Li, Surui (); Li, Zeju (); Qin, Chen (); Bai, Wenjia (); Rueckert, Daniel ()",,"Ouyang, Cheng (); Chen, Chen (); Li, Surui (); Li, Zeju (); Qin, Chen (); Bai, Wenjia (); Rueckert, Daniel ()",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1143055508,46 Information and Computing Sciences, 4611 Machine Learning,,,,,,,,,,

Second, we take inspiration from ""layer-decomposition"", and innovate on the
training regime with simulated tumor data. Third, we conduct extensive ablation

necessity of different proxy tasks. We demonstrate that, with sufficient
texture randomization in simulation, model trained on synthetic data can
effortlessly generalise to segment real tumor data. Forth, our approach
achieves superior results for zero-shot tumor segmentation on different
downstream datasets, BraTS2018 for brain tumor segmentation and LiTS2017 for

Annotation is expensive, time-consuming, and often requires expert knowledge, particularly in the medical field. Here, we suggest using minimal user interaction in the form of extreme point clicks to train a segmentation model which, in effect, can be used to speed up medical image annotation. An initial segmentation is generated based on the extreme points using the random walker algorithm. This initial segmentation is then used as a noisy supervision signal to train a fully convolutional network that can segment the organ of interest, based on the provided user clicks. Through experimentation on several medical imaging datasets, we show that the predictions of the network can be refined using several rounds of training with the prediction from the same weakly annotated data. Further improvements are shown using the clicked points within a custom-designed loss and attention mechanism.

We develop a cubic volume-measure-preserving OMT (V-OMT) model for the implementation of this conversion.

We then propose an effective two-phase U-net algorithm combined with the V-OMT algorithm for training and validation. First, we use the U-net and V-OMT algorithms to precisely predict the whole tumor (WT) region. Second, we expand this predicted WT region with dilation and create a smooth function by convoluting the step-like function associated with the WT region in the brain image with a 5×5×5 blur tensor. Then, a new V-OMT algorithm with mesh refinement is constructed to allow the U-net algorithm to effectively train Net1--Net3 models.

all around the world. Deep learning has been adopted as an effective technique
to aid COVID-19 detection and segmentation from computed tomography (CT)
images. The major challenge lies in the inadequate public COVID-19 datasets.
Recently, transfer learning has become a widely used technique that leverages
the knowledge gained while solving one problem and applying it to a different
but related problem. However, it remains unclear whether various non-COVID19
lung lesions could contribute to segmenting COVID-19 infection areas and how to
better conduct this transfer procedure. This paper provides a way to understand
the transferability of non-COVID19 lung lesions. Based on a publicly available
COVID-19 CT dataset and three public non-COVID19 datasets, we evaluate four
transfer learning methods using 3D U-Net as a standard encoder-decoder method.
The results reveal the benefits of transferring knowledge from non-COVID19 lung
lesions, and learning from multiple lung lesion datasets can extract more
general features, leading to accurate and robust pre-trained models. We further
show the capability of the encoder to learn feature representations of lung
lesions, which improves segmentation accuracy and facilitates training
convergence. In addition, our proposed Hybrid-encoder learning method
incorporates transferred lung lesion features from non-COVID19 datasets
effectively and achieves significant improvement. These findings promote new
insights into transfer learning for COVID-19 CT image segmentation, which can
also be further generalized to other medical tasks.",,,arXiv,,,2020-06-23,2020,,,,,,All OA, Green,Preprint,"Wang, Yixin; Zhang, Yao; Liu, Yang; Tian, Jiang; Zhong, Cheng; Shi, Zhongchao; Zhang, Yang; He, Zhiqiang","Wang, Yixin (); Zhang, Yao (); Liu, Yang (); Tian, Jiang (); Zhong, Cheng (); Shi, Zhongchao (); Zhang, Yang (); He, Zhiqiang ()",,"Wang, Yixin (); Zhang, Yao (); Liu, Yang (); Tian, Jiang (); Zhong, Cheng (); Shi, Zhongchao (); Zhang, Yang (); He, Zhiqiang ()",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1128748075,46 Information and Computing Sciences, 4611 Machine Learning,,,,,,,,,,

networks (CNNs) constitutes a large portion of research in medical image
analysis. The majority of CNN-based methods rely on an abundance of labeled
data for proper training. Labeled medical data is often scarce, but unlabeled
data is more widely available. This necessitates approaches that go beyond
traditional supervised learning and leverage unlabeled data for segmentation
tasks. This work investigates the potential of autoencoder-extracted features
to improve segmentation with a CNN. Two strategies were considered. First,
transfer learning where pretrained autoencoder features were used as
initialization for the convolutional layers in the segmentation network.
Second, multi-task learning where the tasks of segmentation and feature
extraction, by means of input reconstruction, were learned and optimized
simultaneously. A convolutional autoencoder was used to extract features from
unlabeled data and a multi-scale, fully convolutional CNN was used to perform
the target task of 3D liver segmentation in CT images. For both strategies,
experiments were conducted with varying amounts of labeled and unlabeled
training data. The proposed learning strategies improved results in $75\%$ of
the experiments compared to training from scratch and increased the dice score
by up to $0.040$ and $0.024$ for a ratio of unlabeled to labeled training data
of about $32 : 1$ and $12.5 : 1$, respectively. The results indicate that both

In recent years, a number of variations to the seminal UNet have been proposed with promising results in the papers introducing them. However, there is no clear consensus if any of these architectures generalize as well and the UNet currently remains the methodological golden standard. For the segmentation of 3D scans, UNet‐inspired methods are also dominant, but there is a larger variety across applications. By evaluating the architectures in a different dimensionality, embedded in a different method, and for a different task, we aimed to evaluate if any of these UNet alternatives are promising as a new golden standard that generalizes even better than the UNet. The purpose of this study was to compare UNet inspired models for generalized 3D segmentation. To efficiently segment the 3D scans, we employed each UNet variant architecture as the central 2D segmentation core in the multi‐planar UNet 3D segmentation method that previously demonstrated excellent generalization in the MICCAI Segmentation Decathlon. It would strongly support a claim of generalizability, if a promising UNet‐variant consistently outperforms the UNet in this quite different setting. The experimental results show that the multi‐planar‐based UNet2+ (MPUNet2+) method outperforms other variants including the original multi‐planar UNet (MPUNet).","Work on the LIRA cohort was supported by an unrestricted grant from Novo Nordisk A/S including active and placebo medicine, and by the Cambridge Weight Plan donating dietary supplements.

543,pub.1131970407,10.48550/arxiv.2010.11008,,,What is Wrong with Continual Learning in Medical Image Segmentation?,"Continual learning protocols are attracting increasing attention from the
medical imaging community. In continual environments, datasets acquired under
different conditions arrive sequentially; and each is only available for a
limited period of time. Given the inherent privacy risks associated with
medical data, this setup reflects the reality of deployment for deep learning
diagnostic radiology systems. Many techniques exist to learn continuously for
image classification, and several have been adapted to semantic segmentation.
Yet most struggle to accumulate knowledge in a meaningful manner. Instead, they
focus on preventing the problem of catastrophic forgetting, even when this
reduces model plasticity and thereon burdens the training process. This puts
into question whether the additional overhead of knowledge preservation is
worth it - particularly for medical image segmentation, where computation
requirements are already high - or if maintaining separate models would be a
better solution. We propose UNEG, a simple and widely applicable multi-model
benchmark that maintains separate segmentation and autoencoder networks for
each training stage. The autoencoder is built from the same architecture as the
segmentation network, which in our case is a full-resolution nnU-Net, to bypass
any additional design decisions. During inference, the reconstruction error is
used to select the most appropriate segmenter for each test image. Open this
concept, we develop a fair evaluation scheme for different continual learning
settings that moves beyond the prevention of catastrophic forgetting. Our
results across three regions of interest (prostate, hippocampus, and right
ventricle) show that UNEG outperforms several continual learning methods,
reinforcing the need for strong baselines in continual learning research.",,,arXiv,,,2020-10-21,2020,,,,,,All OA, Green,Preprint,"Gonzalez, Camila; Lemke, Nick; Sakas, Georgios; Mukhopadhyay, Anirban","Gonzalez, Camila (); Lemke, Nick (); Sakas, Georgios (); Mukhopadhyay, Anirban ()",,"Gonzalez, Camila (); Lemke, Nick (); Sakas, Georgios (); Mukhopadhyay, Anirban ()",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1131970407,46 Information and Computing Sciences, 4611 Machine Learning,,,,,,,,,,

Due to complex anatomy around the pancreatic tissue and high demands for clinical experience, the assisted pancreas segmentation system will greatly promote clinical efficiency. However, the existing segmentation model suffers from poor generalization among images from multiple hospitals. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end data-adaptive pancreas segmentation system to tackle the problems of lack of annotations and model generalizability. The system employs adversarial learning to transfer features from labeled domains to unlabeled domains, seeking a dynamic balance between domain discrimination and unsupervised segmentation. The image quality control toolbox is embedded in the system, which standardizes image quality in terms of intensity, field of view, and so on, to decrease heterogeneity among image domains. In addition, the system implements a data-adaptive process end-to-end without complex operations by doctors. The experiments are conducted on an annotated public dataset and an unannotated in-hospital dataset. The results indicate that after data adaptation, the segmentation performance measured by the dice similarity coefficient on unlabeled images improves from 58.79% to 75.43%, with a gain of 16.64%.

necessitate expert label curation, while unlabelled image data might be
relatively abundant. Active learning methods aim to prioritise a subset of
available image data for expert annotation, for label-efficient model training.
We develop a controller neural network that measures priority of images in a
sequence of batches, as in batch-mode active learning, for multi-class
segmentation tasks. The controller is optimised by rewarding positive
task-specific performance gain, within a Markov decision process (MDP)
environment that also optimises the task predictor. In this work, the task
predictor is a segmentation network. A meta-reinforcement learning algorithm is
proposed with multiple MDPs, such that the pre-trained controller can be
adapted to a new MDP that contains data from different institutes and/or
requires segmentation of different organs or structures within the abdomen. We
present experimental results using multiple CT datasets from more than one
thousand patients, with segmentation tasks of nine different abdominal organs,
to demonstrate the efficacy of the learnt prioritisation controller function
and its cross-institute and cross-organ adaptability. We show that the proposed
adaptable prioritisation metric yields converging segmentation accuracy for the
novel class of kidney, unseen in training, using between approximately 40\% to
60\% of labels otherwise required with other heuristic or random prioritisation
metrics. For clinical datasets of limited size, the proposed adaptable
prioritisation offers a performance improvement of 22.6\% and 10.2\% in Dice

Segmenting the pancreas from abdominal CT images is a challenging task because the morphology of the pancreas varies greatly among different individuals and may be affected by problems such as the unbalanced category and blurred boundaries. This paper proposes a two-stage Trans-Deformer network to solve these problems of pancreas segmentation. To be specific, we first use 2D Unet for coarse segmentation to generate candidate regions of the pancreas. In the fine segmentation stage, we propose to integrate deformable convolution into Vision Transformer (VIT) for solving the deformation problem of the pancreas. For the problem of blurred boundaries caused by low contrast in the pancreas, a multi-input module based on wavelet decomposition is proposed to make our network pay more attention to high-frequency texture information.

However, these models largely lack transparency about the uncertainty in their predictions, potentially giving clinicians a false sense of reliability that may lead to grave consequences in patient care. Growing calls for Transparent and Responsible AI have promoted Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) to capture and communicate uncertainty in a systematic and principled manner. However, traditional Bayesian UQ methods remain prohibitively costly for large, million-dimensional tumor segmentation DNNs such as the U-Net. In this work, we discuss a computationally-efficient UQ approach via the partially Bayesian neural networks (pBNN). In pBNN, only a single layer, strategically selected based on gradient-based sensitivity analysis, is targeted for Bayesian inference. We illustrate the effectiveness of pBNN in capturing the full uncertainty for a 7.8-million parameter U-Net. We also demonstrate how practitioners and model developers can use the pBNN's predictions to better understand the model's capabilities and behavior.","Experiments were performed on Armis2 HPC Clusters provided by UM&#x27;s Precision Health Initiative.

Convolutional neural network has become more diverse and effective in recent years. However, at present, most networks are designed for a single dataset (i.e., a single organ or target). The designed network is only suitable for a single dataset, and its accuracy is very different (especially small-size image datasets). In response to this problem, a collaborative network can be designed to simultaneously extract the specific and common features of a multi-dataset (i.e., multiple organs or targets). The network can be used for multi-dataset segmentation and help to balance the segmentation performance of different datasets, especially to improve the accuracy of small-size image datasets. By exploring the adapters modified by the convolution kernels, the adaptive weight update strategy and the network branched structure, the paper proposes a multi-dataset collaborative image segmentation network, called Md-Unet, which integrates a shared-specific adapter (SSA), an asymmetric similarity loss function with the proposed adaptive weight update strategy, and a dual-branch. Experimental results showed that compared with the baseline 3D U2Net, the accuracy of the module using the SSA was improved by 3.7%, using several loss functions with the proposed adaptive weight update strategy was improved by 0.64%–30.63%, and using dual-branch integrated architecture was improved by 17.47%.

attempt to address the existing knowledge gap by conducting an exhaustive study
of membership inference attacks and defences in the domain of semantic image

learning settings can be considerably more vulnerable than the previously
considered classification settings. We additionally investigate a threat model
where a dishonest adversary can perform model poisoning to aid their inference
and evaluate the effects that these adaptations have on the success of
membership inference attacks. We quantitatively evaluate the attacks on a
number of popular model architectures across a variety of semantic segmentation

a network of lower-order tensors. They have been most commonly used to model

classify the input pixels into foreground and background classes. The
high-dimensional linear model itself is approximated using the matrix product

Despite the thrilling success of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) in automatic pancreas segmentation, the heavy computational complexity of such networks impedes the deployment in clinical applications. To alleviate this issue, this paper establishes a novel end-to-end DCNN model for pursuing high-accurate automatic pancreas segmentation but with low computational cost. Specifically, built upon a simplified FCN architecture, we propose two novel network modules, named as the scale-transferrable feature fusion module (STFFM) and prior propagation module (PPM), respectively, for pancreas segmentation. Equipped with the scale-transferrable operation, STFFM can learn rich fusion features but with very lightweight network architecture. By dynamically adapting the spatial prior to the input slice data as well as the deep feature maps, PPM enables the network model to explore informative spatial priors for pancreas segmentation. Comprehensive experiments on the NIH dataset and the MSD dataset are conducted to evaluate the proposed approach. The obtained experimental results demonstrate that our approach can effectively reduce the computational cost and simultaneously archive the outperforming performance when compared to the state-of-the-art methods.","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grants 61876140 and 61773301, and the China Postdoctoral Support Scheme for Innovative Talents under Grant BX20180236.",,Pattern Recognition,,,2021-06,2021,,2021-06,114,,107762,Closed,Article,"Zhang, Dingwen; Zhang, Jiajia; Zhang, Qiang; Han, Jungong; Zhang, Shu; Han, Junwei","Zhang, Dingwen (School of Mechano-Electronic Engineering, Xidian University, No. 2 South Taibai Road, Xi’an, Shaanxi 710071, China); Zhang, Jiajia (School of Mechano-Electronic Engineering, Xidian University, No. 2 South Taibai Road, Xi’an, Shaanxi 710071, China); Zhang, Qiang (School of Mechano-Electronic Engineering, Xidian University, No. 2 South Taibai Road, Xi’an, Shaanxi 710071, China); Han, Jungong (Computer Science Department, Aberystwyth University, Ceredigion, SY23 3FL, UK); Zhang, Shu (Deepwise AI Lab, NO. 8 Haidian Street, Haidian District, Beijing, 100080, China); Han, Junwei (School of Automation, Northwestern Polytechnical University, 127 West Youyi Road, Beilin District, Xi’an Shaanxi, 710072, PR China)","Zhang, Qiang (Xidian University); Han, Jungong (Aberystwyth University)","Zhang, Dingwen (Xidian University); Zhang, Jiajia (Xidian University); Zhang, Qiang (Xidian University); Han, Jungong (Aberystwyth University); Zhang, Shu (); Han, Junwei (Northwestern Polytechnical University)",36,36,,28.49,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1133007539,46 Information and Computing Sciences, 4605 Data Management and Data Science, 4611 Machine Learning,,,,,,,,,,

anatomical constraints and produced high quality surfaces were a core
technology. Prior to deep learning, statistical shape models that imposed
anatomical constraints and produced high quality surfaces were a core
technology. Today fully-convolutional networks (FCNs), while dominant, do not
offer these capabilities. We present deep implicit statistical shape models
(DISSMs), a new approach to delineation that marries the representation power
of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with the robustness of SSMs. DISSMs use
a deep implicit surface representation to produce a compact and descriptive
shape latent space that permits statistical models of anatomical variance. To
reliably fit anatomically plausible shapes to an image, we introduce a novel
rigid and non-rigid pose estimation pipeline that is modelled as a Markov
decision process(MDP). We outline a training regime that includes inverted
episodic training and a deep realization of marginal space learning (MSL).
Intra-dataset experiments on the task of pathological liver segmentation
demonstrate that DISSMs can perform more robustly than three leading FCN
models, including nnU-Net: reducing the mean Hausdorff distance (HD) by
7.7-14.3mm and improving the worst case Dice-Sorensen coefficient (DSC) by
1.2-2.3%. More critically, cross-dataset experiments on a dataset directly
reflecting clinical deployment scenarios demonstrate that DISSMs improve the

The abdominal organ(s) condition is mostly connected with greater morbidity and mortality. Most patients often have asymptomatic abdominal conditions and symptoms, which are often recognized late; hence the abdomen has been the third most common cause of damage to the human body. That notwithstanding, there may be improved outcomes where the condition of an abdominal organ is detected earlier. Over the years, supervised and semi-supervised machine learning methods have been used to segment abdominal organ(s) in order to detect the organ(s) condition. The supervised methods perform well when the used training data represents the target data, but the methods require large manually annotated data and have adaptation problems. The semi-supervised methods are fast but record poor performance than the supervised if assumptions about the data fail to hold. Current state-of-the-art methods of supervised segmentation are largely based on deep learning techniques due to their good accuracy and success in real world applications. Though it requires a large amount of training data for automatic feature extraction, deep learning can hardly be used. As regards the semi-supervised methods of segmentation, self-training and graph-based techniques have attracted much research attention. Self-training can be used with any classifier but does not have a mechanism to rectify mistakes early. Graph-based techniques thrive on their convexity, scalability, and effectiveness in application but have an out-of-sample problem.

resonance imaging (MRI) has received increased attention in the last decade,
however, the domain shift which arises from different vendors, acquisition
protocols, and biological heterogeneity, remains an important but challenging
obstacle on the path towards clinical implementation. Recently, unsupervised
domain adaptation (UDA) methods have attempted to mitigate this problem by
incorporating self-training with contrastive learning. To better exploit the
underlying semantic information of the image at different levels, we propose a
Multi-level Semantic-guided Contrastive Domain Adaptation (MSCDA) framework to
align the feature representation between domains. In particular, we extend the
contrastive loss by incorporating pixel-to-pixel, pixel-to-centroid, and
centroid-to-centroid contrasts to integrate semantic information of images. We
utilize a category-wise cross-domain sampling strategy to sample anchors from
target images and build a hybrid memory bank to store samples from source
images. Two breast MRI datasets were retrospectively collected: The source
dataset contains non-contrast MRI examinations from 11 healthy volunteers and
the target dataset contains contrast-enhanced MRI examinations of 134 invasive
breast cancer patients. We set up experiments from source T2W image to target
dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)-T1W image (T2W-to-T1W) and from source T1W

multi-disease detection and diagnosis in clinical practice, while most medical
AI systems are built to focus on single organs with a narrow list of a few
diseases. This might severely limit AI's clinical adoption. A certain number of
AI models need to be assembled non-trivially to match the diagnostic process of
a human reading a CT scan. In this paper, we construct a Unified Tumor
Transformer (UniT) model to detect (tumor existence and location) and diagnose
(tumor characteristics) eight major cancer-prevalent organs in CT scans. UniT
is a query-based Mask Transformer model with the output of multi-organ and
multi-tumor semantic segmentation. We decouple the object queries into organ
queries, detection queries and diagnosis queries, and further establish
hierarchical relationships among the three groups. This clinically-inspired
architecture effectively assists inter- and intra-organ representation learning
of tumors and facilitates the resolution of these complex, anatomically related
multi-organ cancer image reading tasks. UniT is trained end-to-end using a
curated large-scale CT images of 10,042 patients including eight major types of
cancers and occurring non-cancer tumors (all are pathology-confirmed with 3D

The presence of pathologies, broken structures or limited field-of-view (FOV)

how to exploit and conduct the prosperous detection-then-segmentation paradigm
in 3D medical data, and propose a steerable, robust, and efficient computing
framework for detection, identification, and segmentation of anatomies in CT
scans. Considering complicated shapes, sizes and orientations of anatomies,

estimation solution in full 3D space using a novel single-stage,
non-hierarchical forward representation. Our whole framework is executed in a
steerable manner where any anatomy of interest can be directly retrieved to
further boost the inference efficiency. We have validated the proposed method
on three medical imaging parsing tasks of ribs, spine, and abdominal organs.
For rib parsing, CT scans have been annotated at the rib instance-level for
quantitative evaluation, similarly for spine vertebrae and abdominal organs.
Extensive experiments on 9-DoF box detection and rib instance segmentation

image segmentation when annotated data is scarce. In this paper, we improve
existing approaches for semi-supervised segmentation with a self-paced and
self-consistent co-training method. To help distillate information from
unlabeled images, we first design a self-paced learning strategy for
co-training that lets jointly-trained neural networks focus on
easier-to-segment regions first, and then gradually consider harder ones.This
is achieved via an end-to-end differentiable loss inthe form of a generalized
Jensen Shannon Divergence(JSD). Moreover, to encourage predictions from
different networks to be both consistent and confident, we enhance this
generalized JSD loss with an uncertainty regularizer based on entropy. The
robustness of individual models is further improved using a self-ensembling
loss that enforces their prediction to be consistent across different training
iterations. We demonstrate the potential of our method on three challenging
image segmentation problems with different image modalities, using small
fraction of labeled data. Results show clear advantages in terms of performance

alleviate the need for large labeled datasets in semantic segmentation. Most
current approaches exploit class activation maps (CAMs), which can be generated
from image-level annotations. Nevertheless, resulting maps have been
demonstrated to be highly discriminant, failing to serve as optimal proxy
pixel-level labels. We present a novel learning strategy that leverages
self-supervision in a multi-modal image scenario to significantly enhance
original CAMs. In particular, the proposed method is based on two observations.
First, the learning of fully-supervised segmentation networks implicitly
imposes equivariance by means of data augmentation, whereas this implicit
constraint disappears on CAMs generated with image tags. And second, the
commonalities between image modalities can be employed as an efficient
self-supervisory signal, correcting the inconsistency shown by CAMs obtained
across multiple modalities. To effectively train our model, we integrate a
novel loss function that includes a within-modality and a cross-modality
equivariant term to explicitly impose these constraints during training. In
addition, we add a KL-divergence on the class prediction distributions to
facilitate the information exchange between modalities, which, combined with
the equivariant regularizers further improves the performance of our model.

limited number of organ or tissue label classes annotated, even when the images
have wide anatomical coverage. With supervised learning, multiple classifiers
are usually needed given these partially annotated datasets. In this work, we
propose a set of strategies to train one single classifier in segmenting all
label classes that are heterogeneously annotated across multiple datasets
without moving into semi-supervised learning. Methods: Masks were first created
from each label image through a process we termed presence masking. Three
presence masking modes were evaluated, differing mainly in weightage assigned
to the annotated and unannotated classes. These masks were then applied to the
loss function during training to remove the influence of unannotated classes.
Results: Evaluation against publicly available CT datasets shows that presence
masking is a viable method for training class-generic classifiers. Our
class-generic classifier can perform as well as multiple class-specific
classifiers combined, while the training duration is similar to that required
for one class-specific classifier. Furthermore, the class-generic classifier
can outperform the class-specific classifiers when trained on smaller datasets.
Finally, consistent results are observed from evaluations against human thigh
and calf MRI datasets collected in-house. Conclusion: The evaluation outcomes
show that presence masking is capable of significantly improving both training
and inference efficiency across imaging modalities and anatomical regions.
Improved performance may even be observed on small datasets. Significance:
Presence masking strategies can reduce the computational resources and costs
involved in manual medical image annotations. All codes are publicly available

to the segmentation of medical images. Semi-supervised learning seeks to
overcome this limitation by exploiting unlabeled examples in the learning
process. In this paper, we present a novel semi-supervised segmentation method
that leverages mutual information (MI) on categorical distributions to achieve
both global representation invariance and local smoothness. In this method, we
maximize the MI for intermediate feature embeddings that are taken from both
the encoder and decoder of a segmentation network. We first propose a global MI
loss constraining the encoder to learn an image representation that is
invariant to geometric transformations. Instead of resorting to
computationally-expensive techniques for estimating the MI on continuous
feature embeddings, we use projection heads to map them to a discrete cluster
assignment where MI can be computed efficiently. Our method also includes a
local MI loss to promote spatial consistency in the feature maps of the decoder
and provide a smoother segmentation. Since mutual information does not require
a strict ordering of clusters in two different assignments, we incorporate a
final consistency regularization loss on the output which helps align the
cluster labels throughout the network. We evaluate the method on four
challenging publicly-available datasets for medical image segmentation.

image analysis. Medical imaging--focusing on particular parts of the body for
defined clinical purposes--generates images of great similarity in anatomy
across patients and yields sophisticated anatomical patterns across images,
which are associated with rich semantics about human anatomy and which are
natural visual words. We show that these visual words can be automatically
harvested according to anatomical consistency via self-discovery, and that the
self-discovered visual words can serve as strong yet free supervision signals
for deep models to learn semantics-enriched generic image representation via
self-supervision (self-classification and self-restoration). Our extensive
experiments demonstrate the annotation efficiency of TransVW by offering higher
performance and faster convergence with reduced annotation cost in several
applications. Our TransVW has several important advantages, including (1)
TransVW is a fully autodidactic scheme, which exploits the semantics of visual
words for self-supervised learning, requiring no expert annotation; (2) visual
word learning is an add-on strategy, which complements existing self-supervised

It is essential to generate trust for day-to-day tasks, especially in the sensible domains as medical imaging. Although many works have addressed this problem by generating visual explanation maps, they often provide noisy and inaccurate results forcing heuristic regularization unrelated to the classifier in question. In this paper, we propose a general perspective of the visual explanation problem overcoming these limitations. We show that visual explanation can be produced as the difference between two generated images obtained via two specific conditional generative models. Both generative models are trained using the classifier to explain and a database to enforce the following properties: (i) All images generated by the first generator are classified similarly to the input image, whereas the second generator’s outputs are classified oppositely. (ii) All generated images belong to the distribution of real images. (iii) The distances between the input image and the corresponding generated images are minimal so that the difference between the generated elements only reveals relevant information for the studied classifier. Using symmetrical and cyclic constraints, we present two different approximations and implementations of the general formulation.

the enormous deployments of supervised and unsupervised learning models,
attempts to use reinforcement learning in medical image analysis are scarce.

dominated medical image segmentation, which is crucial for various clinical
purposes. However, the inherent locality of convolution makes CNNs fail to
fully exploit global context, essential for better recognition of some
structures, e.g., brain lesions. Transformers have recently proven promising
performance on vision tasks, including semantic segmentation, mainly due to
their capability of modeling long-range dependencies. Nevertheless, the
quadratic complexity of attention makes existing Transformer-based models use
self-attention layers only after somehow reducing the image resolution, which
limits the ability to capture global contexts present at higher resolutions.
Therefore, this work introduces a family of models, dubbed Factorizer, which
leverages the power of low-rank matrix factorization for constructing an
end-to-end segmentation model. Specifically, we propose a linearly scalable
approach to context modeling, formulating Nonnegative Matrix Factorization
(NMF) as a differentiable layer integrated into a U-shaped architecture. The
shifted window technique is also utilized in combination with NMF to
effectively aggregate local information. Factorizers compete favorably with
CNNs and Transformers in terms of accuracy, scalability, and interpretability,
achieving state-of-the-art results on the BraTS dataset for brain tumor
segmentation and ISLES'22 dataset for stroke lesion segmentation. Highly
meaningful NMF components give an additional interpretability advantage to
Factorizers over CNNs and Transformers. Moreover, our ablation studies reveal a
distinctive feature of Factorizers that enables a significant speed-up in
inference for a trained Factorizer without any extra steps and without
sacrificing much accuracy. The code and models are publicly available at

all medical fields. Especially in areas, related to medical imaging it plays a
big role. However, in interventional radiotherapy (brachytherapy) deep learning
is still in an early phase. In this review, first, we investigated and
scrutinised the role of deep learning in all processes of interventional
radiotherapy and directly related fields. Additionally we summarised the most
recent developments. To reproduce results of deep learning algorithms both
source code and training data must be available. Therefore, a second focus of
this work was on the analysis of the availability of open source, open data and
open models. In our analysis, we were able to show that deep learning plays
already a major role in some areas of interventional radiotherapy, but is still
hardly presented in others. Nevertheless, its impact is increasing with the
years, partly self-propelled but also influenced by closely related fields.
Open source, data and models are growing in number but are still scarce and
unevenly distributed among different research groups. The reluctance in
publishing code, data and models limits reproducibility and restricts
evaluation to mono-institutional datasets. Summarised, deep learning will
change positively the workflow of interventional radiotherapy but there is room
for improvement when it comes to reproducible results and standardised
evaluation methods.",,,arXiv,,,2022-05-16,2022,,,,,,All OA, Green,Preprint,"Fechter, Tobias; Sachpazidis, Ilias; Baltas, Dimos","Fechter, Tobias (); Sachpazidis, Ilias (); Baltas, Dimos ()",,"Fechter, Tobias (); Sachpazidis, Ilias (); Baltas, Dimos ()",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1147931821,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences, 51 Physical Sciences, 5105 Medical and Biological Physics,,,,,,,,,

relies on large labeled datasets for model training. However, acquiring and
manually labeling a large medical image set is resource-intensive, expensive,
and sometimes impractical due to data sharing and privacy issues. To address
this challenge, we propose AdvChain, a generic adversarial data augmentation
framework, aiming at improving both the diversity and effectiveness of training
data for medical image segmentation tasks. AdvChain augments data with dynamic
data augmentation, generating randomly chained photo-metric and geometric
transformations to resemble realistic yet challenging imaging variations to
expand training data. By jointly optimizing the data augmentation model and a
segmentation network during training, challenging examples are generated to
enhance network generalizability for the downstream task. The proposed
adversarial data augmentation does not rely on generative networks and can be
used as a plug-in module in general segmentation networks. It is
computationally efficient and applicable for both low-shot supervised and
semi-supervised learning. We analyze and evaluate the method on two MR image
segmentation tasks: cardiac segmentation and prostate segmentation with limited
labeled data. Results show that the proposed approach can alleviate the need
for labeled data while improving model generalization ability, indicating its
practical value in medical imaging applications.",,,arXiv,,,2021-08-07,2021,,,,,,All OA, Green,Preprint,"Chen, Chen; Qin, Chen; Ouyang, Cheng; Li, Zeju; Wang, Shuo; Qiu, Huaqi; Chen, Liang; Tarroni, Giacomo; Bai, Wenjia; Rueckert, Daniel","Chen, Chen (); Qin, Chen (); Ouyang, Cheng (); Li, Zeju (); Wang, Shuo (); Qiu, Huaqi (); Chen, Liang (); Tarroni, Giacomo (); Bai, Wenjia (); Rueckert, Daniel ()",,"Chen, Chen (); Qin, Chen (); Ouyang, Cheng (); Li, Zeju (); Wang, Shuo (); Qiu, Huaqi (); Chen, Liang (); Tarroni, Giacomo (); Bai, Wenjia (); Rueckert, Daniel ()",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1140316668,46 Information and Computing Sciences, 4611 Machine Learning,,,,,,,,,,

Cancer presents a unique context that influences treatment decisions, given its diverse forms of disease evolution. Biomedical imaging allows non-invasive assessment of diseases based on visual evaluations, leading to better clinical outcome prediction and therapeutic planning. Early methods of brain cancer characterization predominantly relied upon the statistical modeling of neuroimaging data. Driven by breakthroughs in computer vision, deep learning has become the de facto standard in medical imaging. Integrated statistical and deep learning methods have recently emerged as a new direction in the automation of medical practice unifying multi-disciplinary knowledge in medicine, statistics, and artificial intelligence. In this study, we critically review major statistical, deep learning, and probabilistic deep learning models and their applications in brain imaging research with a focus on MRI-based brain tumor segmentation.

386,pub.1144584589,10.48550/arxiv.2201.02831,,,CrossMoDA 2021 challenge: Benchmark of Cross-Modality Domain Adaptation  techniques for Vestibular Schwannoma and Cochlea Segmentation,"Domain Adaptation (DA) has recently raised strong interests in the medical
imaging community. While a large variety of DA techniques has been proposed for
image segmentation, most of these techniques have been validated either on
private datasets or on small publicly available datasets. Moreover, these
datasets mostly addressed single-class problems. To tackle these limitations,
the Cross-Modality Domain Adaptation (crossMoDA) challenge was organised in
conjunction with the 24th International Conference on Medical Image Computing
and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI 2021). CrossMoDA is the first large
and multi-class benchmark for unsupervised cross-modality DA. The challenge's
goal is to segment two key brain structures involved in the follow-up and
treatment planning of vestibular schwannoma (VS): the VS and the cochleas.
Currently, the diagnosis and surveillance in patients with VS are performed
using contrast-enhanced T1 (ceT1) MRI. However, there is growing interest in
using non-contrast sequences such as high-resolution T2 (hrT2) MRI. Therefore,
we created an unsupervised cross-modality segmentation benchmark. The training
set provides annotated ceT1 (N=105) and unpaired non-annotated hrT2 (N=105).
The aim was to automatically perform unilateral VS and bilateral cochlea
segmentation on hrT2 as provided in the testing set (N=137). A total of 16
teams submitted their algorithm for the evaluation phase. The level of
performance reached by the top-performing teams is strikingly high (best median
Dice - VS:88.4%; Cochleas:85.7%) and close to full supervision (median Dice -
VS:92.5%; Cochleas:87.7%). All top-performing methods made use of an
image-to-image translation approach to transform the source-domain images into
pseudo-target-domain images. A segmentation network was then trained using
these generated images and the manual annotations provided for the source
image.",,,arXiv,,,2022-01-08,2022,,,,,,All OA, Green,Preprint,"Dorent, Reuben; Kujawa, Aaron; Ivory, Marina; Bakas, Spyridon; Rieke, Nicola; Joutard, Samuel; Glocker, Ben; Cardoso, Jorge; Modat, Marc; Batmanghelich, Kayhan; Belkov, Arseniy; Calisto, Maria Baldeon; Choi, Jae Won; Dawant, Benoit M.; Dong, Hexin; Escalera, Sergio; Fan, Yubo; Hansen, Lasse; Heinrich, Mattias P.; Joshi, Smriti; Kashtanova, Victoriya; Kim, Hyeon Gyu; Kondo, Satoshi; Kruse, Christian N.; Lai-Yuen, Susana K.; Li, Hao; Liu, Han; Ly, Buntheng; Oguz, Ipek; Shin, Hyungseob; Shirokikh, Boris; Su, Zixian; Wang, Guotai; Wu, Jianghao; Xu, Yanwu; Yao, Kai; Zhang, Li; Ourselin, Sebastien; Shapey, Jonathan; Vercauteren, Tom","Dorent, Reuben (); Kujawa, Aaron (); Ivory, Marina (); Bakas, Spyridon (); Rieke, Nicola (); Joutard, Samuel (); Glocker, Ben (); Cardoso, Jorge (); Modat, Marc (); Batmanghelich, Kayhan (); Belkov, Arseniy (); Calisto, Maria Baldeon (); Choi, Jae Won (); Dawant, Benoit M.

various medical imaging benchmarking challenges, including the Brain Tumor
Segmentation (BraTS) challenges. However, the task of focal pathology
multi-compartment segmentation (e.g., tumor and lesion sub-regions) is
particularly challenging, and potential errors hinder translating DL models
into clinical workflows. Quantifying the reliability of DL model predictions in
the form of uncertainties could enable clinical review of the most uncertain
regions, thereby building trust and paving the way toward clinical translation.
Several uncertainty estimation methods have recently been introduced for DL
medical image segmentation tasks. Developing scores to evaluate and compare the
performance of uncertainty measures will assist the end-user in making more
informed decisions. In this study, we explore and evaluate a score developed
during the BraTS 2019 and BraTS 2020 task on uncertainty quantification
(QU-BraTS) and designed to assess and rank uncertainty estimates for brain
tumor multi-compartment segmentation. This score (1) rewards uncertainty
estimates that produce high confidence in correct assertions and those that
assign low confidence levels at incorrect assertions, and (2) penalizes
uncertainty measures that lead to a higher percentage of under-confident
correct assertions. We further benchmark the segmentation uncertainties
generated by 14 independent participating teams of QU-BraTS 2020, all of which
also participated in the main BraTS segmentation task. Overall, our findings
confirm the importance and complementary value that uncertainty estimates
provide to segmentation algorithms, highlighting the need for uncertainty
quantification in medical image analyses. Finally, in favor of transparency and
reproducibility, our evaluation code is made publicly available at:

309,pub.1142526737,10.48550/arxiv.2111.05408,,,Robust deep learning-based semantic organ segmentation in hyperspectral  images,"Semantic image segmentation is an important prerequisite for
context-awareness and autonomous robotics in surgery. The state of the art has
focused on conventional RGB video data acquired during minimally invasive
surgery, but full-scene semantic segmentation based on spectral imaging data
and obtained during open surgery has received almost no attention to date. To
address this gap in the literature, we are investigating the following research
questions based on hyperspectral imaging (HSI) data of pigs acquired in an open
surgery setting: (1) What is an adequate representation of HSI data for neural
network-based fully automated organ segmentation, especially with respect to
the spatial granularity of the data (pixels vs. superpixels vs. patches vs.
full images)? (2) Is there a benefit of using HSI data compared to other
modalities, namely RGB data and processed HSI data (e.g. tissue parameters like
oxygenation), when performing semantic organ segmentation? According to a
comprehensive validation study based on 506 HSI images from 20 pigs, annotated
with a total of 19 classes, deep learning-based segmentation performance
increases, consistently across modalities, with the spatial context of the
input data. Unprocessed HSI data offers an advantage over RGB data or processed
data from the camera provider, with the advantage increasing with decreasing
size of the input to the neural network. Maximum performance (HSI applied to
whole images) yielded a mean DSC of 0.90 ((standard deviation (SD)) 0.04),
which is in the range of the inter-rater variability (DSC of 0.89 ((standard
deviation (SD)) 0.07)). We conclude that HSI could become a powerful image
modality for fully-automatic surgical scene understanding with many advantages
over traditional imaging, including the ability to recover additional
functional tissue information. Code and pre-trained models:

The scientific community has focused its attention on DL due to its versatility, high performance, high generalization capacity, and multidisciplinary uses, among many other qualities. In addition, a large amount of medical data and the development of more powerful computers has also fostered an interest in this area. This paper presents an overview of current deep learning methods, starting from the most straightforward concept but accompanied by the mathematical models that are behind the functionality of this type of intelligence. In the first instance, the fundamental concept of artificial neural networks is introduced, progressively covering convolutional structures, recurrent networks, attention models, up to the current structure known as the Transformer. Secondly, all the basic concepts involved in training and other common elements in the design of the architectures are introduced. Thirdly, some of the key elements in modern networks for medical image classification and segmentation are shown. Subsequently, a review of some applications realized in the last years is shown, where the main features related to DL are highlighted. Finally, the perspectives and future expectations of deep learning are presented.",This research was supported by the research division from INDIGO Technologies (https://indigo.tech/).,,Informatics in Medicine Unlocked,,,2021,2021,,2021,26,,100723,All OA, Gold,Article,"Anaya-Isaza, Andrés; Mera-Jiménez, Leonel; Zequera-Diaz, Martha","Anaya-Isaza, Andrés (Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, 110231, Bogotá, Colombia; INDIGO Research, 110221, Bogotá, Colombia); Mera-Jiménez, Leonel (Faculty of Engineering, Bioengineering Program, Universidad de Antioquia, 050010, Medellín, Colombia; INDIGO Research, 110221, Bogotá, Colombia); Zequera-Diaz, Martha (School of Engineering, BASPI/FootLab (Bioengineering, Signal Analysis, And Image Processing Research Group), Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, 110231, Bogotá, Colombia)","Mera-Jiménez, Leonel (University of Antioquia; )","Anaya-Isaza, Andrés (Pontificia Universidad Javeriana); Mera-Jiménez, Leonel (University of Antioquia); Zequera-Diaz, Martha (Pontificia Universidad Javeriana)",20,20,,17.5,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.imu.2021.100723,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1140872386,42 Health Sciences, 4203 Health Services and Systems,,,,,,,,,,

Additionally, the machine learning algorithms are classified as either supervised or unsupervised, and they are further partitioned if the amount of work that falls under a certain scheme is significant. Moreover, different datasets and challenges found in literature and websites containing masks of the aforementioned tissues are thoroughly discussed, highlighting the organizers’ original contributions and those of other researchers. Also, the metrics used excessively in the literature are mentioned in our review, stressing their relevance to the task at hand.

and successively a critical counterpart in the computer-aided diagnosis
paradigm. U-Net is the most widespread image segmentation architecture due to
its flexibility, optimized modular design, and success in all medical image
modalities. Over the years, the U-Net model achieved tremendous attention from
academic and industrial researchers. Several extensions of this network have
been proposed to address the scale and complexity created by medical tasks.
Addressing the deficiency of the naive U-Net model is the foremost step for
vendors to utilize the proper U-Net variant model for their business. Having a
compendium of different variants in one place makes it easier for builders to
identify the relevant research. Also, for ML researchers it will help them
understand the challenges of the biological tasks that challenge the model. To
address this, we discuss the practical aspects of the U-Net model and suggest a
taxonomy to categorize each network variant. Moreover, to measure the
performance of these strategies in a clinical application, we propose fair
evaluations of some unique and famous designs on well-known datasets. We
provide a comprehensive implementation library with trained models for future
research. In addition, for ease of future studies, we created an online list of
U-Net papers with their possible official implementation. All information is

validation are an underestimated global problem. Particularly in automatic
biomedical image analysis, chosen performance metrics often do not reflect the
domain interest, thus failing to adequately measure scientific progress and
hindering translation of ML techniques into practice. To overcome this, our
large international expert consortium created Metrics Reloaded, a comprehensive
framework guiding researchers in the problem-aware selection of metrics.
Following the convergence of ML methodology across application domains, Metrics
Reloaded fosters the convergence of validation methodology. The framework was
developed in a multi-stage Delphi process and is based on the novel concept of
a problem fingerprint - a structured representation of the given problem that
captures all aspects that are relevant for metric selection, from the domain
interest to the properties of the target structure(s), data set and algorithm
output. Based on the problem fingerprint, users are guided through the process
of choosing and applying appropriate validation metrics while being made aware
of potential pitfalls. Metrics Reloaded targets image analysis problems that
can be interpreted as a classification task at image, object or pixel level,
namely image-level classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, and
instance segmentation tasks. To improve the user experience, we implemented the
framework in the Metrics Reloaded online tool, which also provides a point of
access to explore weaknesses, strengths and specific recommendations for the
most common validation metrics. The broad applicability of our framework across
domains is demonstrated by an instantiation for various biological and medical
image analysis use cases.",,,arXiv,,,2022-06-03,2022,,,,,,All OA, Green,Preprint,"Maier-Hein, Lena; Reinke, Annika; Godau, Patrick; Tizabi, Minu D.; Büttner, Florian; Christodoulou, Evangelia; Glocker, Ben; Isensee, Fabian; Kleesiek, Jens; Kozubek, Michal; Reyes, Mauricio; Riegler, Michael A.; Wiesenfarth, Manuel; Kavur, Emre; Sudre, Carole H.; Baumgartner, Michael; Eisenmann, Matthias; Heckmann-Nötzel, Doreen; Rädsch, A.
