This results in anisotropic 3D images which could lead to difficulty in diagnosis, especially in late gadolinium enhanced (LGE) cardiac MRI, which is the reference imaging modality for locating the extent of myocardial fibrosis in various cardiovascular diseases like myocardial infarction and atrial fibrillation. To address this issue, we propose a self-supervised deep learning-based approach to enhance the through-plane resolution of the LGE MRI images. We train a convolutional neural network (CNN) model on randomly extracted patches of short-axis LGE MRI images and this trained CNN model is used to leverage the information learnt from the high-resolution in-plane data to improve the through-plane resolution. We conducted experiments on LGE MRI dataset made available through the 2018 atrial segmentation challenge. Our proposed method achieved a mean peak signal-to-noise-ratio (PSNR) of 36.99 and 35.92 and a mean structural similarity index measure (SSIM) of 0.9 and 0.84 on training the CNN model using low-resolution images downsampled by a scale factor of 2 and 4, respectively.",This work was supported by grants from the National Science Foundation (Award No. OAC 1808530) and the National Institutes of Health (Award No. R35GM128877).

The proposed CNN framework consists of two branches: a super-resolution branch with a 3D dense deep back-projection network (DBPN) as the backbone to learn the mapping of low-resolution LGE cardiac volumes to high-resolution LGE cardiac volumes, and a gradient branch that learns the mapping of the gradient map of low resolution LGE cardiac volumes to the gradient map of their high-resolution counterparts. The gradient branch of the CNN provides additional cardiac structure information to the super-resolution branch to generate structurally more accurate super-resolution LGE MRI images.

Multiscale feature fusion is one of the important factors affecting the accuracy of medical image segmentation. Existing transformer-based UNet methods do not comprehensively explore multiscale feature fusion, and there is still much room for improvement. In this paper, we propose a novel multiresolution aggregation transformer UNet (MRA-TUNet) based on multiscale input and coordinate attention for medical image segmentation. It realizes multiresolution aggregation from the following two aspects: (1) On the input side, a multiresolution aggregation module is used to fuse the input image information of different resolutions, which enhances the input features of the network. (2) On the output side, an output feature selection module is used to fuse the output information of different scales to better extract coarse-grained information and fine-grained information. We try to introduce a coordinate attention structure for the first time to further improve the segmentation performance. We compare with state-of-the-art medical image segmentation methods on the automated cardiac diagnosis challenge and the 2018 atrial segmentation challenge. Our method achieved average dice score of 0.911 for right ventricle (RV), 0.890 for myocardium (Myo), 0.961 for left ventricle (LV), and 0.923 for left atrium (LA). The experimental results on two datasets show that our method outperforms eight state-of-the-art medical image segmentation methods in dice score, precision, and recall.","The author thanks the whole authors in the referred articles.

Quantification of clinical results (CR) requires precise segmentation. Clinicians statistically compare CRs to ensure reproducibility. Convolutional Neural Network developers compare their results via metrics. Aim: Introducing software capable of automatic multilevel comparison. A multilevel analysis covering segmentations and CRs builds on a generic software backend. Metrics and CRs are calculated with geometric accuracy. Segmentations and CRs are connected to track errors and their effects. An interactive GUI makes the software accessible to different users. The software’s multilevel comparison was tested on a use case based on cardiac function assessment. The software shows good reader agreement in CRs and segmentation metrics (Dice > 90%). Decomposing differences by cardiac position revealed excellent agreement in midventricular slices: > 90% but poorer segmentations in apical (> 71%) and basal slices (> 74%). Further decomposition by contour type locates the largest millilitre differences in the basal right cavity (> 3 ml). Visual inspection shows these differences being caused by different basal slice choices. The software illuminated reader differences on several levels. Producing spreadsheets and figures concerning metric values and CR differences was automated. A multilevel reader comparison is feasible and extendable to other cardiac structures in the future.,"We wish to thank the members of the WG CMR for input at different steps.

They have made significant progress. However, due to the intrinsic locality of convolution operations, the convolution neural network-based region and edge aggregation has limitations in modeling long-range information. To solve this problem, we proposed a novel transformer-based multilevel region and edge aggregation network for MR image segmentation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first literature on transformer-based region and edge aggregation. We first extract multilevel region and edge features using a dual-branch module. Then, the region and edge features at different levels are inferred and aggregated through multiple transformer-based inference modules to form multilevel complementary features. Finally, the attention feature selection module aggregates these complementary features with the corresponding level region and edge features to decode the region and edge features. We evaluated our method on a public MR dataset: Medical image computation and computer-assisted intervention atrial segmentation challenge (ASC). Meanwhile, the private MR dataset considered infrapatellar fat pad (IPFP). Our method achieved a dice score of 93.2% for ASC and 91.9% for IPFP. Compared with other 2D segmentation methods, our method improved a dice score by 0.6% for ASC and 3.0% for IPFP.",Shaolong Chen and Lijie Zhong contributed equally to this work.

Catheter ablation (CA) is the only AF treatment with a long-term curative effect as it involves destroying arrhythmogenic tissue in the atria. However, its success rate is suboptimal, approximately 50% after a 2-year follow-up, and this high AF recurrence rate warrants significant improvements. Image-guidance of CA procedures have shown clinical promise, enabling the identification of key patient anatomical and pathological (such as fibrosis) features of atrial tissue, which require ablation. However, the latter approach still suffers from a lack of functional information and the need to interpret structures in the images by a clinician. Deep learning plays an increasingly important role in biomedicine, facilitating efficient diagnosis and treatment of clinical problems. This study applies deep reinforcement learning in combination with patient imaging (to provide structural information of the atria) and image-based modelling (to provide functional information) to design patient-specific CA strategies to guide clinicians and improve treatment success rates. To achieve this, patient-specific 2D left atrial (LA) models were derived from late-gadolinium enhancement (LGE) MRI scans of AF patients and were used to simulate patient-specific AF scenarios. Then a reinforcement Q-learning algorithm was created, where an ablating agent moved around the 2D LA, applying CA lesions to terminate AF and learning through feedback imposed by a reward policy. The agent achieved 84% success rate in terminating AF during training and 72% success rate in testing. Finally, AF recurrence rate was measured by attempting to re-initiate AF in the 2D atrial models after CA with 11% recurrence showing a great improvement on the existing therapies. Thus, reinforcement Q-learning algorithms can predict successful CA strategies from patient MRI data and help to improve the patient-specific guidance of CA therapy.",,,Frontiers in Physiology,,,2021-08-25,2021,2021-08-25,,12,,733139,All OA; Gold,Article,"Muizniece, Laila; Bertagnoli, Adrian; Qureshi, Ahmed; Zeidan, Aya; Roy, Aditi; Muffoletto, Marica; Aslanidi, Oleg","Muizniece, Laila (School of Biomedical Engineering & Imaging Sciences, King’s College London, London, United Kingdom); Bertagnoli, Adrian (School of Biomedical Engineering & Imaging Sciences, King’s College London, London, United Kingdom; Department of Biomedical Engineering, ETH Zürich, Zürich, Switzerland); Qureshi, Ahmed (School of Biomedical Engineering & Imaging Sciences, King’s College London, London, United Kingdom); Zeidan, Aya (School of Biomedical Engineering & Imaging Sciences, King’s College London, London, United Kingdom); Roy, Aditi (School of Biomedical Engineering & Imaging Sciences, King’s College London, London, United Kingdom; Department of Computer Science, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom); Muffoletto, Marica (School of Biomedical Engineering & Imaging Sciences, King’s College London, London, United Kingdom); Aslanidi, Oleg (School of Biomedical Engineering & Imaging Sciences, King’s College London, London, United Kingdom)","Aslanidi, Oleg (King's College London)","Muizniece, Laila (King's College London); Bertagnoli, Adrian (King's College London; ETH Zurich); Qureshi, Ahmed (King's College London); Zeidan, Aya (King's College London); Roy, Aditi (King's College London; University of Oxford); Muffoletto, Marica (King's College London); Aslanidi, Oleg (King's College London)",2,2,0.22,1.37,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2021.733139/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1140629851,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3208 Medical Physiology,

In clinical, the semantic-level segmentation of LA consumes much time and labor. Although supervised deep learning methods can somewhat solve this problem, a high-efficient deep learning model requires abundant labeled data that is hard to acquire. Therefore, the research on automatic LA segmentation of leveraging unlabeled data is highly required. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised LA segmentation framework including a segmentation model and a classification model. The segmentation model takes volumes from both labeled and unlabeled data as input and generates predictions of LAs. And then, a classification model maps these predictions to class-vectors for each input. Afterward, to leverage the class information, we construct a contrastive consistency loss function based on these class-vectors, so that the model can enlarge the discrepancy of the inter-class and compact the similarity of the intra-class for learning more distinguishable representation. Moreover, we set the class-vectors from the labeled data as references to the class-vectors from the unlabeled data to relieve the influence of the unreliable prediction for the unlabeled data. At last, we evaluate our semi-supervised LA segmentation framework on a public LA dataset using four universal metrics and compare it with recent state-of-the-art models. The proposed model achieves the best performance on all metrics with a Dice Score of 89.81 %, Jaccard of 81.64 %, 95 % Hausdorff distance of 7.15 mm, and Average Surface Distance of 1.82 mm.

The relative prior distributions of the multiple objects in the three-dimensional (3D) space can be obtained through integrating the geometric morphological relationship of each target object to some reference objects. In cardiac CTA images, the cross-sections of ascending and descending aorta can play the role of the reference objects. We employed the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator that utilizes anatomic prior knowledge to address this problem of localizing multiple objects.

However, direct segmentation of LGE-MRIs is challenging due to the varying intensities caused by contrast agents. Since most clinical studies have relied on manual, labor-intensive approaches, automatic methods are of high interest, particularly optimized machine learning approaches. To address this, we organized the 2018 Left Atrium Segmentation Challenge using 154 3D LGE-MRIs, currently the world's largest atrial LGE-MRI dataset, and associated labels of the left atrium segmented by three medical experts, ultimately attracting the participation of 27 international teams. In this paper, extensive analysis of the submitted algorithms using technical and biological metrics was performed by undergoing subgroup analysis and conducting hyper-parameter analysis, offering an overall picture of the major design choices of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and practical considerations for achieving state-of-the-art left atrium segmentation. Results show that the top method achieved a Dice score of 93.2% and a mean surface to surface distance of 0.7 mm, significantly outperforming prior state-of-the-art. Particularly, our analysis demonstrated that double sequentially used CNNs, in which a first CNN is used for automatic region-of-interest localization and a subsequent CNN is used for refined regional segmentation, achieved superior results than traditional methods and machine learning approaches containing single CNNs. This large-scale benchmarking study makes a significant step towards much-improved segmentation methods for atrial LGE-MRIs, and will serve as an important benchmark for evaluating and comparing the future works in the field. Furthermore, the findings from this study can potentially be extended to other imaging datasets and modalities, having an impact on the wider medical imaging community.","The authors would like to thank Nvidia, MedTech CoRE New Zealand, and Arterys for providing prizes for the winners of the 2018 LA Segmentation Challenge.

7563,pub.1149273495,10.1016/j.media.2022.102530,35839737,,Mutual consistency learning for semi-supervised medical image segmentation,"In this paper, we propose a novel mutual consistency network (MC-Net+) to effectively exploit the unlabeled data for semi-supervised medical image segmentation. The MC-Net+ model is motivated by the observation that deep models trained with limited annotations are prone to output highly uncertain and easily mis-classified predictions in the ambiguous regions (e.g., adhesive edges or thin branches) for medical image segmentation. Leveraging these challenging samples can make the semi-supervised segmentation model training more effective. Therefore, our proposed MC-Net+ model consists of two new designs. First, the model contains one shared encoder and multiple slightly different decoders (i.e., using different up-sampling strategies). The statistical discrepancy of multiple decoders' outputs is computed to denote the model's uncertainty, which indicates the unlabeled hard regions. Second, we apply a novel mutual consistency constraint between one decoder's probability output and other decoders' soft pseudo labels. In this way, we minimize the discrepancy of multiple outputs (i.e., the model uncertainty) during training and force the model to generate invariant results in such challenging regions, aiming at regularizing the model training. We compared the segmentation results of our MC-Net+ model with five state-of-the-art semi-supervised approaches on three public medical datasets. Extension experiments with two standard semi-supervised settings demonstrate the superior performance of our model over other methods, which sets a new state of the art for semi-supervised medical image segmentation.

Some existing semi-supervised methods for medical image segmentation enforce the regularization of training by implicitly perturbing data or networks to perform the consistency. Most consistency regularization methods focus on data level or network structure level, and rarely of them focus on the task level. It may not directly lead to an improvement in task accuracy. To overcome the problem, this work proposes a semi-supervised dual-task consistent joint learning framework with task-level regularization for 3D medical image segmentation. Two branches are utilized to simultaneously predict the segmented and signed distance maps, and they can learn useful information from each other by constructing a consistency loss function between the two tasks. The segmentation branch learns rich information from both labeled and unlabeled data to strengthen the constraints on the geometric structure of the target. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets show that the proposed method can achieve better performance compared with other state-of-the-art works. It illustrates our method improves segmentation performance by utilizing unlabeled data and consistent regularization.",,,IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics,,,2022-01-21,2022,2022-01-21,2022-01-21,PP,99,1-1,Closed,Article,"Chen, Qi-Qi; Sun, Zhao-Hui; Wei, Chuan-Feng; Wu, Edmond Q.; Ming, Dong","Chen, Qi-Qi (Shanghai, Shanghai, China, (e-mail: 13297040055@163.com)); Sun, Zhao-Hui (Department of Industrial Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 12474 Shanghai, Shanghai, China, 200240 (e-mail: zh.sun@sjtu.edu.cn)); Wei, Chuan-Feng (Beijing, Beijing, China, (e-mail: 57410703@qq.com)); Wu, Edmond Q.

In this study, an image segmentation method based on sequence relationship learning and multi-scale feature fusion is proposed for 3D to 2D sequence conversion in cardiac magnetic resonance images and the varying scales of left atrial structures within different slices. Firstly, a convolutional neural network layer with an attention module was designed to extract and fuse contextual information at different scales in the image, to strengthen the target features using the correlation between features in different regions within the image, and to improve the network's ability to distinguish the left atrial structure. Secondly, a recurrent neural network layer oriented to two-dimensional images was designed to capture the correlation of left atrial structures in adjacent slices by simulating the continuous relationship between sequential image slices. Finally, a combined loss function was constructed to reduce the effect of positive and negative sample imbalance and improve model stability.

The previous quantification of atrial scars relies on a two-phase segmentation for LA and atrial scars due to their large volume difference (unbalanced atrial targets). In this paper, we propose an inter-cascade generative adversarial network, namely JAS-GAN, to segment the unbalanced atrial targets from LGE CMR images automatically and accurately in an end-to-end way. Firstly, JAS-GAN investigates an adaptive attention cascade to automatically correlate the segmentation tasks of the unbalanced atrial targets. The adaptive attention cascade mainly models the inclusion relationship of the two unbalanced atrial targets, where the estimated LA acts as the attention map to adaptively focus on the small atrial scars roughly. Then, an adversarial regularization is applied to the segmentation tasks of the unbalanced atrial targets for making a consistent optimization. It mainly forces the estimated joint distribution of LA and atrial scars to match the real ones. We evaluated the performance of our JAS-GAN on a 3D LGE CMR dataset with 192 scans. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, our proposed approach yielded better segmentation performance (Average Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) values of 0.946 and 0.821 for LA and atrial scars, respectively), which indicated the effectiveness of our proposed approach for segmenting unbalanced atrial targets.",,"This work was supported in part by the Key-Area Research and Development Program of Guangdong Province under Grant 2019B010110001, in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grants 61771464 and U1801265, in part by the Key Program for International Cooperation Projects of Guangdong Province under Grant 2018A050506031, in part by the Guangdong Natural Science Funds for Distinguished Young Scholar under Grant 2019B151502031, in part by British Heart Foundation under Grants TG/18/5/34111 and PG/16/78/32402, in part by Innovative Medicines Initiative under Grant H2020-JTI-IMI2 101005122, and in part by ERC H2020 under Grant H2020-SC1-FA-DTS-2019-1952172.",IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics,,"Cicatrix; Gadolinium; Heart Atria; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging",2022-01-17,2022,2022-01-17,2022-01,26,1,103-114,All OA; Green,Article,"Chen, Jun; Yang, Guang; Khan, Habib; Zhang, Heye; Zhang, Yanping; Zhao, Shu; Mohiaddin, Raad; Wong, Tom; Firmin, David; Keegan, Jennifer","Chen, Jun (School of Biomedical Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510275, China); Yang, Guang (Cardiovascular Research Centre, Royal Brompton Hospital, London, SW3 6NP, U.K.; National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London, London, SW7 2AZ, U.K.); Khan, Habib (Cardiovascular Research Centre, Royal Brompton Hospital, SW3 6NP, London, U.K.); Zhang, Heye (School of Biomedical Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510275, China); Zhang, Yanping (School of Computer Science and Technology, Anhui University, Hefei, 230601, China); Zhao, Shu (School of Computer Science and Technology, Anhui University, Hefei, 230601, China); Mohiaddin, Raad (Cardiovascular Research Centre, Royal Brompton Hospital, London, SW3 6NP, U.K.; National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London, London, SW7 2AZ, U.K.); Wong, Tom (Cardiovascular Research Centre, Royal Brompton Hospital, London, SW3 6NP, U.K.; National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London, London, SW7 2AZ, U.K.); Firmin, David (Cardiovascular Research Centre, Royal Brompton Hospital, London, SW3 6NP, U.K.; National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London, London, SW7 2AZ, U.K.); Keegan, Jennifer (Cardiovascular Research Centre, Royal Brompton Hospital, London, SW3 6NP, U.K.; National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London, London, SW7 2AZ, U.K.)","Yang, Guang (Royal Brompton Hospital; Imperial College London)","Chen, Jun (Sun Yat-sen University); Yang, Guang (Royal Brompton Hospital; Imperial College London); Khan, Habib (Royal Brompton Hospital); Zhang, Heye (Sun Yat-sen University); Zhang, Yanping (Anhui University); Zhao, Shu (Anhui University); Mohiaddin, Raad (Royal Brompton Hospital; Imperial College London); Wong, Tom (Royal Brompton Hospital; Imperial College London); Firmin, David (Royal Brompton Hospital; Imperial College London); Keegan, Jennifer (Royal Brompton Hospital; Imperial College London)",31,31,,,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.00234,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1137750801,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4611 Machine Learning,

When diagnosing and detecting heart disease, medical imaging can provide high-resolution scans of every organ or tissue in the heart. The diagnostic results obtained by the imaging method are less susceptible to human interference. They can process numerous patient information, assist doctors in early detection of heart disease, intervene and treat patients, and improve the understanding of heart disease symptoms and clinical diagnosis of great significance. In a computer-aided diagnosis system, accurate segmentation of cardiac scan images is the basis and premise of subsequent thoracic function analysis and 3D image reconstruction.
EXISTING TECHNIQUES: This paper systematically reviews automatic methods and some difficulties for cardiac segmentation in radiographic images. Combined with recent advanced deep learning techniques, the feasibility of using deep learning network models for image segmentation is discussed, and the commonly used deep learning frameworks are compared.
DEVELOPED INSIGHTS: There are many standard methods for medical image segmentation, such as traditional methods based on regions and edges and methods based on deep learning. Because of characteristics of non-uniform grayscale, individual differences, artifacts and noise of medical images, the above image segmentation methods have certain limitations. It is tough to obtain the needed results sensitivity and accuracy when performing heart segmentation. The deep learning model proposed has achieved good results in image segmentation. Accurate segmentation improves the accuracy of disease diagnosis and reduces subsequent irrelevant computations.
SUMMARY: There are two requirements for accurate segmentation of radiological images. One is to use image segmentation to improve the development of computer-aided diagnosis. The other is to achieve complete segmentation of the heart. When there are lesions or deformities in the heart, there will be some abnormalities in the radiographic images, and the segmentation algorithm needs to segment the heart altogether. The quantity of processing inside a certain range will no longer be a restriction for real-time detection with the advancement of deep learning and the enhancement of hardware device performance.","This work was funded by National Key RD Program of China (Grant numbers 2017YFC1703600, 2017YFC1703606), National Science Foundation of China (Grant Number 81771927), Natural Science Foundation of Top Talent of Shenzhen Technology University (Grant number 2019010801011), and Stable Support Project for Shenzhen Higher Education Institutions (Grant number SZWD2021011).",,Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine,,"Deep Learning; Heart Diseases; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Radiography",2022-04-19,2022,2022-04-19,2022-06,220,,106821,Closed,Article,"Song, Yucheng; Ren, Shengbing; Lu, Yu; Fu, Xianghua; Wong, Kelvin K L","Song, Yucheng (School of Computer Science and Engineering, Central South University, Changsha, China.); Ren, Shengbing (School of Computer Science and Engineering, Central South University, Changsha, China.); Lu, Yu (College of Big Data and Internet, Shenzhen Technology University, Shenzhen, China.

However, to date, most existing semi-supervised learning (SSL) algorithms treat the labelled images and unlabelled images separately and ignore the explicit connection between them; this disregards essential shared information and thus hinders further performance improvements. To mine the shared information between the labelled and unlabelled images, we introduce a class-specific representation extraction approach, in which a task-affinity module is specifically designed for representation extraction. We further cast the representation into two different views of feature maps; one is focusing on low-level context, while the other concentrates on structural information. The two views of feature maps are incorporated into the task-affinity module, which then extracts the class-specific representations to aid the knowledge transfer from the labelled images to the unlabelled images. In particular, a task-affinity consistency loss between the labelled images and unlabelled images based on the multi-scale class-specific representations is formulated, leading to a significant performance improvement. Experimental results on three datasets show that our method consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Our findings highlight the potential of consistency between class-specific knowledge for semi-supervised medical image segmentation.

Acquiring massive high-quality labeled data from experts is often infeasible. Unfortunately, without sufficient high-quality pixel-level labels, the usual data-driven learning-based segmentation methods often struggle with deficient training. As a result, we are often forced to collect additional labeled data from multiple sources with varying label qualities. However, directly introducing additional data with low-quality noisy labels may mislead the network training and undesirably offset the efficacy provided by those high-quality labels. To address this issue, we propose a Mean-Teacher-assisted Confident Learning (MTCL) framework constructed by a teacher-student architecture and a label self-denoising process to robustly learn segmentation from a small set of high-quality labeled data and plentiful low-quality noisy labeled data. Particularly, such a synergistic framework is capable of simultaneously and robustly exploiting (i) the additional dark knowledge inside the images of low-quality labeled set via perturbation-based unsupervised consistency, and (ii) the productive information of their low-quality noisy labels via explicit label refinement. Comprehensive experiments on left atrium segmentation with simulated noisy labels and hepatic and retinal vessel segmentation with real-world noisy labels demonstrate the superior segmentation performance of our approach as well as its effectiveness on label denoising.",This research was done with Tencent Healthcare (Shenzhen) Company Ltd. and Tencent Jarvis Laboratory.,This work was supported in part by the Research Grant Council of Hong Kong under General Research Fund 14205419 and in part by the Scientific and Technical Innovation 2030-“New Generation Artificial Intelligence” Project (2020AAA0104100).,IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging,,,2022-10-27,2022,2022-10-27,2022-11,41,11,3062-3073,Closed,Article,"Xu, Zhe; Lu, Donghuan; Luo, Jie; Wang, Yixin; Yan, Jiangpeng; Ma, Kai; Zheng, Yefeng; Tong, Raymond Kai-Yu","Xu, Zhe (Department of Biomedical Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China); Lu, Donghuan (Tencent Healthcare (Shenzhen) Company Ltd., Shenzhen, 518057, China; Tencent Jarvis Laboratory, Shenzhen, 518057, China); Luo, Jie (Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, 02115, USA); Wang, Yixin (Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, 94305, USA); Yan, Jiangpeng (Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, Beijing, 100190, China); Ma, Kai (Tencent Healthcare (Shenzhen) Company Ltd., Shenzhen, 518057, China; Tencent Jarvis Laboratory, Shenzhen, 518057, China); Zheng, Yefeng (Tencent Healthcare (Shenzhen) Company Ltd., Shenzhen, 518057, China; Tencent Jarvis Laboratory, Shenzhen, 518057, China); Tong, Raymond Kai-Yu (Department of Biomedical Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China)","Tong, Raymond Kai-Yu (Chinese University of Hong Kong)","Xu, Zhe (Chinese University of Hong Kong); Lu, Donghuan (Tencent Healthcare (China)); Luo, Jie (Harvard University; Brigham and Women's Hospital); Wang, Yixin (Stanford University); Yan, Jiangpeng (Tsinghua University); Ma, Kai (Tencent Healthcare (China)); Zheng, Yefeng (Tencent Healthcare (China)); Tong, Raymond Kai-Yu (Chinese University of Hong Kong)",2,2,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1148084908,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4603 Computer Vision and Multimedia Computation; 4605 Data Management and Data Science; 4611 Machine Learning,

However, their achievement is proving slow to transition to widespread use in medical clinics because of robustness issues leading to low trust of clinicians to their results. Predicting run-time quality of segmentation masks can be useful to warn clinicians against poor results. Despite its importance, there are few studies on this problem. To address this gap, we propose a quality control method based on the agreement across decoders of a multi-view network, TMS-Net, measured by the cosine similarity. The network takes three view inputs resliced from the same 3D image along different axes. Different from previous multi-view networks, TMS-Net has a single encoder and three decoders, leading to better noise robustness, segmentation performance and run-time quality estimation in our experiments on the segmentation of the left atrium on STACOM 2013 and STACOM 2018 challenge datasets. We also present a way to generate poor segmentation masks by using noisy images generated with engineered noise and Rician noise to simulate undertraining, high anisotropy and poor imaging settings problems. Our run-time quality estimation method show a good classification of poor and good quality segmentation masks with an AUC reaching to 0.97 on STACOM 2018. We believe that TMS-Net and our run-time quality estimation method has a high potential to increase the thrust of clinicians to automatic image analysis tools.","This work is financially supported by Bursa Technical University Scientific Research Projects Units , with the project number of 211N043.",,Computers in Biology and Medicine,,"Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Heart Atria; Anisotropy",2022-12-14,2022,2022-12-14,2023-01,152,,106422,All OA; Green,Article,"Uslu, Fatmatülzehra; Bharath, Anil A","Uslu, Fatmatülzehra (Bursa Technical University, Electrical and Electronics Engineering Department, Bursa, 16310, Turkey.

6443,pub.1153241596,10.1109/tmi.2022.3225687,36449588,,Semi-supervised medical image segmentation using adversarial consistency learning and dynamic convolution network,"Popular semi-supervised medical image segmentation networks often suffer from error supervision from unlabeled data since they usually use consistency learning under different data perturbations to regularize model training. These networks ignore the relationship between labeled and unlabeled data, and only compute single pixel-level consistency leading to uncertain prediction results. Besides, these networks often require a large number of parameters since their backbone networks are designed depending on supervised image segmentation tasks. Moreover, these networks often face a high over-fitting risk since a small number of training samples are popular for semi-supervised image segmentation. To address the above problems, in this paper, we propose a novel adversarial self-ensembling network using dynamic convolution (ASE-Net) for semi-supervised medical image segmentation. First, we use an adversarial consistency training strategy (ACTS) that employs two discriminators based on consistency learning to obtain prior relationships between labeled and unlabeled data. The ACTS can simultaneously compute pixel-level and image-level consistency of unlabeled data under different data perturbations to improve the prediction quality of labels. Second, we design a dynamic convolution-based bidirectional attention component (DyBAC) that can be embedded in any segmentation network, aiming at adaptively adjusting the weights of ASE-Net based on the structural information of input samples. This component effectively improves the feature representation ability of ASE-Net and reduces the overfitting risk of the network. The proposed ASE-Net has been extensively tested on three publicly available datasets, and experiments indicate that ASE-Net is superior to state-of-the-art networks, and reduces computational costs and memory overhead.

It is widely used in clinical routine to diagnose and characterize the myocardial tissue in a wide range of ischemic and nonischemic cardiomyopathies. The recent growing interest in imaging left atrial fibrosis has led to the development of novel whole-heart high-resolution late gadolinium enhancement (HR-LGE) techniques. Indeed, conventional LGE is acquired in multiple breath-holds with limited spatial resolution: ~1.4-1.8 mm in plane and 6-8 mm slice thickness, according to the Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance standardized guidelines. Such large voxel size prevents its use in thin structures such as the atrial or right ventricular walls. Whole-heart 3D HR-LGE images are acquired in free breathing to increase the spatial resolution (up to 1.3 × 1.3 × 1.3 mm3 ) and offer a better detection and depiction of focal atrial fibrosis. The downside of this increased resolution is the extended scan time of around 10 min, which hampers the spread of HR-LGE in clinical practice. Initially introduced for atrial fibrosis imaging, HR-LGE interest has evolved to be a tool to detect small scars in the ventricles and guide ablation procedures. Indeed, the detection of scars, nonvisible with conventional LGE, can be crucial in the diagnosis of myocardial infarction with nonobstructed coronary arteries, in the detection of the arrhythmogenic substrate triggering ventricular arrhythmia, and improve the confidence of clinicians in the challenging diagnoses such as the arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy. HR-LGE also offers a precise visualization of left ventricular scar morphology that is particularly useful in planning ablation procedures and guiding them through the fusion of HR-LGE images with electroanatomical mapping systems. In this narrative review, we attempt to summarize the technical particularities of whole-heart HR-LGE acquisition and provide an overview of its clinical applications with a particular focus on the ventricles.

However, at higher PFA doses, the temperature rise in the tissue during PFA may exceed the thermal damage threshold, at which time intracardiac pulsatile blood flow plays a crucial role in suppressing this temperature rise. This study aims to compare the effect of heat dissipation of the different methods in simulating the pulsatile blood flow during PFA. This study first constructed an anatomy-based left atrium (LA) model and then applied the convective heat transfer (CHT) method and the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method to the model, respectively, and the thermal convective coefficients used in the CHT method are 984 (W/m2*K) (blood-myocardium interface) and 4372 (W/m2*K) (blood-catheter interface), respectively. Then, it compared the effect of the above two methods on the maximum temperature of myocardium and blood, as well as the myocardial ablation volumes caused by irreversible electroporation (IRE) and hyperthermia under different PFA parameters. Compared with the CFD method, the CHT method underestimates the maximum temperature of myocardium and blood; the differences in the maximum temperature of myocardium and blood between the two methods at the end of the last pulse are significant (>1 °C), and the differences in the maximum temperature of blood at the end of the last pulse interval are significant (>1 °C) only at a pulse amplitude greater than 1000 V or pulse number greater than 10. Under the same pulse amplitude and different heat dissipation methods, the IRE ablation volumes are the same. Compared with the CFD method, the CHT method underestimates the hyperthermia ablation volume; the differences in the hyperthermia ablation volume are significant (>1 mm3) only at a pulse amplitude greater than 1000 V, a pulse interval of 250 ms, or a pulse number greater than 10. Additionally, the hyperthermia ablation isosurfaces are completely wrapped by the IRE ablation isosurfaces in the myocardium. Thus, during PFA, compared with the CFD method, the CHT method cannot accurately simulate the maximum myocardial temperature; however, except at the above PFA parameters, the CHT method can accurately simulate the maximum blood temperature and the myocardial ablation volume caused by IRE and hyperthermia. Additionally, within the range of the PFA parameters used in this study, the temperature rise during PFA may not lead to the appearance of additional hyperthermia ablation areas beyond the IRE ablation area in the myocardium.",,"This study received financial support from the National Key R&D Program of China, grant No. 2022YFC2404904 & 2021YFC2400203, Shanghai Municipal Commission of Science and Technology, grant No. 21S31906900, Shanghai Municipal Commission of Economy and Information Technology, grant No. GYQJ-2018-2-05, and Medical Engineering Fund of Fudan University, grant No. yg2021-38.",Journal of Cardiovascular Development and Disease,,,2023-01-30,2023,2023-01-30,,10,2,56,All OA; Gold,Article,"Zang, Lianru; Gu, Kaihao; Ji, Xingkai; Zhang, Hao; Yan, Shengjie; Wu, Xiaomei","Zang, Lianru (Center for Biomedical Engineering, School of Information Science and Technology, Fudan University, Shanghai 200438, China.); Gu, Kaihao (Center for Biomedical Engineering, School of Information Science and Technology, Fudan University, Shanghai 200438, China.); Ji, Xingkai (Center for Biomedical Engineering, School of Information Science and Technology, Fudan University, Shanghai 200438, China.); Zhang, Hao (Center for Biomedical Engineering, School of Information Science and Technology, Fudan University, Shanghai 200438, China.); Yan, Shengjie (Center for Biomedical Engineering, School of Information Science and Technology, Fudan University, Shanghai 200438, China.); Wu, Xiaomei (Center for Biomedical Engineering, School of Information Science and Technology, Fudan University, Shanghai 200438, China.; Academy for Engineering and Technology, Fudan University, Shanghai 200433, China.; Key Laboratory of Medical Imaging Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention (MICCAI) of Shanghai, Fudan University, Shanghai 200032, China.; Shanghai Engineering Research Center of Assistive Devices, Shanghai 200093, China.; Yiwu Research Institute, Fudan University, Yiwu 322000, China.)","Yan, Shengjie (Fudan University); Wu, Xiaomei (Fudan University; Fudan University; ; University of Shanghai for Science and Technology; Fudan University)","Zang, Lianru (Fudan University); Gu, Kaihao (Fudan University); Ji, Xingkai (Fudan University); Zhang, Hao (Fudan University); Yan, Shengjie (Fudan University); Wu, Xiaomei (Fudan University; Fudan University; University of Shanghai for Science and Technology; Fudan University)",0,0,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2308-3425/10/2/56/pdf?version=1675092705,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1154982170,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3201 Cardiovascular Medicine and Haematology,

This study constructed an anatomy-based left atrium (LA) model incorporating fiber orientation and selected various electrical conductivity and ablation targets to investigate the effect of anisotropic electrical conductivity (AC), compared with isotropic electrical conductivity (IC), on the ablation characteristics of PFA in AF treatment. The results show that the percentage differences in the size of the surface ablation area between AC and IC are greater than 73.71%; the maximum difference in the size of the ablation isosurface between AC and IC at different locations in the atrial wall is 3.65 mm (X-axis), 3.65 mm (Z-axis), and 4.03 mm (X-axis), respectively; and the percentage differences in the size of the ablation volume are greater than 6.9%. Under the condition of the pulse, the amplitude is 1000 V, the total PFA duration is 1 s, and the pulse train interval is 198.4 ms; the differences in the temperature increase between AC and IC in LA are less than 2.46 °C. Hence, this study suggests that in further exploration of the computational study of PFA in AF treatment using the same or similar conditions as those used here (myocardial electrical conductivity, pulse parameters, and electric field intensity damage threshold), to obtain more accurate computational results, it is necessary to adopt AC rather than IC to investigate the size of the surface ablation area, the size of the ablation isosurface, or the size of the ablation volume generated by PFA in LA.

Better prevention and treatment of AF are needed to reduce AF-associated morbidity and mortality. Several major mechanisms cause AF in patients, including genetic predispositions to AF development. Genome-wide association studies have identified a number of genetic variants in association with AF populations, with the strongest hits clustering on chromosome 4q25, close to the gene for the homeobox transcription PITX2. Because of the inherent complexity of the human heart, experimental and basic research is insufficient for understanding the functional impacts of PITX2 variants on AF. Linking PITX2 properties to ion channels, cells, tissues, atriums and the whole heart, computational models provide a supplementary tool for achieving a quantitative understanding of the functional role of PITX2 in remodelling atrial structure and function to predispose to AF. It is hoped that computational approaches incorporating all we know about PITX2-related structural and electrical remodelling would provide better understanding into its proarrhythmic effects leading to development of improved anti-AF therapies.

The position and extent of LA scars provide important information on the pathophysiology and progression of atrial fibrillation (AF). Hence, LA LGE MRI computing and analysis are essential for computer-assisted diagnosis and treatment stratification of AF patients. Since manual delineations can be time-consuming and subject to intra- and inter-expert variability, automating this computing is highly desired, which nevertheless is still challenging and under-researched. This paper aims to provide a systematic review on computing methods for LA cavity, wall, scar, and ablation gap segmentation and quantification from LGE MRI, and the related literature for AF studies. Specifically, we first summarize AF-related imaging techniques, particularly LGE MRI. Then, we review the methodologies of the four computing tasks in detail and summarize the validation strategies applied in each task as well as state-of-the-art results on public datasets. Finally, the possible future developments are outlined, with a brief survey on the potential clinical applications of the aforementioned methods. The review indicates that the research into this topic is still in the early stages. Although several methods have been proposed, especially for the LA cavity segmentation, there is still a large scope for further algorithmic developments due to performance issues related to the high variability of enhancement appearance and differences in image acquisition.","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (61971142, 62111530195 and 62011540404) and the development fund for Shanghai talents (2020015).

Late gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (LGE-MRI) is employed for the non-invasive assessment of LA fibrotic tissue. Unfortunately, the analysis of LGE-MRI relies on manual tracing of LA boundaries. This task is time-consuming and prone to high inter-observer variability. Therefore, an automatic approach for LA wall detection would be very helpful. In this study, we compared the performance of different deep architectures - U-Net and attention U-Net (AttnU-Net) - and different loss functions - Dice loss (DL) and focal Tversky loss (FTL) to automatically detect LA boundaries from LGE-MRI data. In addition, AttnU-Net was trained without deep supervision (DS) and multi-scale inputs (MI), with DS and with DS+MI. No statistically significant differences were found training the networks with DL or FTL. U-Net was the best-performing algorithm overall, outperforming significantly AttnU-Net with a Dice Coefficient of 0.9015±0.0308 (mean ± standard deviation). However, no significant differences were found between U-Net and AttnU-Net DS/DS+MI.

Since unlabeled data is generally abundant, most existing semi-supervised approaches focus on how to make full use of both limited labeled data and abundant unlabeled data. In this paper, we propose a novel semi-supervised strategy called reciprocal learning for medical image segmentation, which can be easily integrated into any CNN architecture. Concretely, the reciprocal learning works by having a pair of networks, one as a student and one as a teacher. The student model learns from pseudo label generated by the teacher. Furthermore, the teacher updates its parameters autonomously according to the reciprocal feedback signal of how well student performs on the labeled set. Extensive experiments on two public datasets show that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art semi-supervised segmentation methods, demonstrating the potential of our strategy for the challenging semi-supervised problems. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/XYZach/RLSSS.","This work was supported in part by the National Key R&amp;D Program of China (No. 2019YFC0118300), in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grants 62071305, 61701312 and 81971631, in part by the Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation (2019A1515010847), in part by the Medical Science and Technology Foundation of Guangdong Province (B2019046), in part by the Natural Science Foundation of Shenzhen University (No. 860-000002110129), and in part by the Shenzhen Peacock Plan (No. KQTD2016053112051497).",,Lecture Notes in Computer Science,Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention – MICCAI 2021,,2021-09-21,2021,2021-09-21,2021,12902,,352-361,Closed,Chapter,"Zeng, Xiangyun; Huang, Rian; Zhong, Yuming; Sun, Dong; Han, Chu; Lin, Di; Ni, Dong; Wang, Yi","Zeng, Xiangyun (National-Regional Key Technology Engineering Laboratory for Medical Ultrasound, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Measurements and Ultrasound Imaging, School of Biomedical Engineering, Health Science Center, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China; Medical UltraSound Image Computing (MUSIC) Lab, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China; Marshall Laboratory of Biomedical Engineering, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China); Huang, Rian (National-Regional Key Technology Engineering Laboratory for Medical Ultrasound, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Measurements and Ultrasound Imaging, School of Biomedical Engineering, Health Science Center, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China; Medical UltraSound Image Computing (MUSIC) Lab, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China; Marshall Laboratory of Biomedical Engineering, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China); Zhong, Yuming (National-Regional Key Technology Engineering Laboratory for Medical Ultrasound, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Measurements and Ultrasound Imaging, School of Biomedical Engineering, Health Science Center, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China; Medical UltraSound Image Computing (MUSIC) Lab, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China; Marshall Laboratory of Biomedical Engineering, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China); Sun, Dong (National-Regional Key Technology Engineering Laboratory for Medical Ultrasound, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Measurements and Ultrasound Imaging, School of Biomedical Engineering, Health Science Center, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China; Medical UltraSound Image Computing (MUSIC) Lab, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China; Marshall Laboratory of Biomedical Engineering, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China); Han, Chu (Department of Radiology, Guangdong Provincial People’s Hospital, Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China); Lin, Di (College of Intelligence and Computing, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China); Ni, Dong (National-Regional Key Technology Engineering Laboratory for Medical Ultrasound, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Measurements and Ultrasound Imaging, School of Biomedical Engineering, Health Science Center, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China; Medical UltraSound Image Computing (MUSIC) Lab, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China; Marshall Laboratory of Biomedical Engineering, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China); Wang, Yi (National-Regional Key Technology Engineering Laboratory for Medical Ultrasound, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Measurements and Ultrasound Imaging, School of Biomedical Engineering, Health Science Center, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China; Medical UltraSound Image Computing (MUSIC) Lab, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China; Marshall Laboratory of Biomedical Engineering, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China)","Wang, Yi (Shenzhen University; Shenzhen University; Shenzhen University)","Zeng, Xiangyun (Shenzhen University; Shenzhen University; Shenzhen University); Huang, Rian (Shenzhen University; Shenzhen University; Shenzhen University); Zhong, Yuming (Shenzhen University; Shenzhen University; Shenzhen University); Sun, Dong (Shenzhen University; Shenzhen University; Shenzhen University); Han, Chu (); Lin, Di (Tianjin University); Ni, Dong (Shenzhen University; Shenzhen University; Shenzhen University); Wang, Yi (Shenzhen University; Shenzhen University; Shenzhen University)",5,5,,4.09,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1141326761,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4611 Machine Learning,

capturing the manifold structure of target objects, and accordingly boosts the
accuracy of medical image segmentation. However, most existing methods encode
the location information in an implicit way, e.g. the distance transform maps,
which describe the relative distance from each pixel to the contour boundary,
for the network to learn. These implicit approaches do not fully exploit the
position information (i.e. absolute location) of targets. In this paper, we
propose a novel loss function, namely residual moment (RM) loss, to explicitly
embed the location information of segmentation targets during the training of
deep learning networks. Particularly, motivated by image moments, the
segmentation prediction map and ground-truth map are weighted by coordinate
information. Then our RM loss encourages the networks to maintain the
consistency between the two weighted maps, which promotes the segmentation
networks to easily locate the targets and extract manifold-structure-related
features. We validate the proposed RM loss by conducting extensive experiments
on two publicly available datasets, i.e., 2D optic cup and disk segmentation
and 3D left atrial segmentation. The experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our RM loss, which significantly boosts the accuracy of
segmentation networks.",,,arXiv,,,2021-06-27,2021,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Wang, Quanziang; Wang, Renzhen; Li, Yuexiang; Ma, Kai; Zheng, Yefeng; Meng, Deyu","Wang, Quanziang (); Wang, Renzhen (); Li, Yuexiang (); Ma, Kai (); Zheng, Yefeng (); Meng, Deyu ()",,"Wang, Quanziang (); Wang, Renzhen (); Li, Yuexiang (); Ma, Kai (); Zheng, Yefeng (); Meng, Deyu ()",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1139220044,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4603 Computer Vision and Multimedia Computation; 4605 Data Management and Data Science; 4611 Machine Learning,

To address the issues, we advocate to firstly constrain the consistency of pixels with and without strong perturbations to apply a sufficient smoothness constraint and further encourage the class-level separation to exploit the low-entropy regularization for the model training. Particularly, in this paper, we propose the SS-Net for semi-supervised medical image segmentation tasks, via exploring the pixel-level Smoothness and inter-class Separation at the same time. The pixel-level smoothness forces the model to generate invariant results under adversarial perturbations. Meanwhile, the inter-class separation encourages individual class features should approach their corresponding high-quality prototypes, in order to make each class distribution compact and separate different classes. We evaluated our SS-Net against five recent methods on the public LA and ACDC datasets. Extensive experimental results under two semi-supervised settings demonstrate the superiority of our proposed SS-Net model, achieving new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on both datasets.

However, most of existing methods underestimate the importance of challenging regions (e.g. small branches or blurred edges) during training. We believe that these unlabeled regions may contain more crucial information to minimize the uncertainty prediction for the model and should be emphasized in the training process. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel Mutual Consistency Network (MC-Net) for semi-supervised left atrium segmentation from 3D MR images. Particularly, our MC-Net consists of one encoder and two slightly different decoders, and the prediction discrepancies of two decoders are transformed as an unsupervised loss by our designed cycled pseudo label scheme to encourage mutual consistency. Such mutual consistency encourages the two decoders to have consistent and low-entropy predictions and enables the model to gradually capture generalized features from these unlabeled challenging regions.

In this context, we propose Cross Task Temporal Consistency, a novel Semi-Supervised Learning framework that combines a self-ensembled learning strategy with cross-consistency constraints derived from the implicit perturbations between the incongruous tasks of multi-headed architectures. More specifically, the Signed Distance Map output of a teacher model is transformed to an approximate segmentation map which acts as a pseudo target for the student model. Simultaneously, the teacher’s segmentation task output is utilized as the objective for the student’s Signed Distance Map derived segmentation output. Our proposed framework is intuitively simple and can be plugged into existing segmentation architectures with minimal computational overhead.

allows to use multi-center training data with privacy protection. However, data
distributions in local centers can vary from each other due to different
imaging vendors, and annotation protocols. Such variation degrades the
performance of learning-based methods. To mitigate the influence, two groups of
methods have been proposed for different aims, i.e., the global methods and the
personalized methods. The former are aimed to improve the performance of a
single global model for all test data from unseen centers (known as generic
data); while the latter target multiple models for each center (denoted as
local data). However, little has been researched to achieve both goals
simultaneously. In this work, we propose a new framework of distributed
learning that bridges the gap between two groups, and improves the performance
for both generic and local data. Specifically, our method decouples the
predictions for generic data and local data, via distribution-conditioned
adaptation matrices. Results on multi-center left atrial (LA) MRI segmentation
showed that our method demonstrated superior performance over existing methods
on both generic and local data. Our code is available at

research. In the segmentation task of medical images, we oftentimes rely on
volumetric data, and thus require the use of 3D architectures which are praised
for their ability to capture more features from the depth dimension. Yet, these
architectures are generally more ineffective in time and compute compared to
their 2D counterpart on account of 3D convolutions, max pooling,
up-convolutions, and other operations used in these networks. Moreover, there
are limited to no 3D pretrained model weights, and pretraining is generally
challenging. To alleviate these issues, we propose to cast volumetric data to
2D super images and use 2D networks for the segmentation task. The method
processes the 3D image by stitching slices side-by-side to generate a super
resolution image. While the depth information is lost, we expect that deep
neural networks can still capture and learn these features. Our goal in this
work is to introduce a new perspective when dealing with volumetric data, and
test our hypothesis using vanilla networks. We hope that this approach, while
achieving close enough results to 3D networks using only 2D counterparts, can

different decoders, and the prediction discrepancies of two decoders are
transformed as an unsupervised loss by our designed cycled pseudo label scheme

This requires highly accurate algorithms as marginal segmentation errors in medical images may lead to inaccurate diagnosis in subsequent procedures. The U-Net framework has become one of the dominant deep neural network architectures for medical image segmentation. Due to complex and irregular shape of objects involved in medical images, robust feature representations that correspond to various spatial transformations are key to achieve successful results.

While previous SSL approaches focus on only one of them (mostly EU), this study shows that SSL segmentation models can benefit more by considering both sources of uncertainty.

It allows to use multi-center training data with privacy protection. However, data distributions in local centers can vary from each other due to different imaging vendors, and annotation protocols. Such variation degrades the performance of learning-based methods. To mitigate the influence, two groups of methods have been proposed for different aims, i.e., the global methods and the personalized methods. The former are aimed to improve the performance of a single global model for all test data from unseen centers (known as generic data); while the latter target multiple models for each center (denoted as local data). However, little has been researched to achieve both goals simultaneously. In this work, we propose a new framework of distributed learning that bridges the gap between two groups, and improves the performance for both generic and local data. Specifically, our method decouples the predictions for generic data and local data, via distribution-conditioned adaptation matrices. Results on multi-center left atrial (LA) MRI segmentation showed that our method demonstrated superior performance over existing methods on both generic and local data.

amount of annotated medical data is often scarce and there are many blurred
pixels near the adhesive edges or in the low-contrast regions. To address the
issues, we advocate to firstly constrain the consistency of pixels with and
without strong perturbations to apply a sufficient smoothness constraint and
further encourage the class-level separation to exploit the low-entropy
regularization for the model training. Particularly, in this paper, we propose
the SS-Net for semi-supervised medical image segmentation tasks, via exploring
the pixel-level smoothness and inter-class separation at the same time. The
pixel-level smoothness forces the model to generate invariant results under
adversarial perturbations. Meanwhile, the inter-class separation encourages
individual class features should approach their corresponding high-quality
prototypes, in order to make each class distribution compact and separate
different classes. We evaluated our SS-Net against five recent methods on the
public LA and ACDC datasets. Extensive experimental results under two
semi-supervised settings demonstrate the superiority of our proposed SS-Net

The U-shaped and skip-connection based on convolution (UNet) has achieved the most advanced performance in the field of medical image segmentation.

First, we synthesize local edge information and global location information to obtain tissue edge features. Second, in order to better utilize the edge information, we propose an edge guidance feature pyramid (EGFP). Edge features interact with area features of different scales to form complementary features of different scales. These complementary features of different scales also interact to represent the complete information of the tissue and improve the adaptability to different tissue scales.

research direction, semi-supervised learning addresses this dilemma by
leveraging unlabeled data information to assist the learning process. In this
paper, a novel geometry-aware semi-supervised learning framework is proposed
for medical image segmentation, which is a consistency-based method.
Considering that the hard-to-segment regions are mainly located around the
object boundary, we introduce an auxiliary prediction task to learn the global
geometric information. Based on the geometric constraint, the ambiguous
boundary regions are emphasized through an exponentially weighted strategy for
the model training to better exploit both labeled and unlabeled data. In
addition, a dual-view network is designed to perform segmentation from
different perspectives and reduce the prediction uncertainty. The proposed

One factor limiting the automatic segmentation of the left atrium is that training network needs a large amount of labeled data, which is expensive and time-consuming. Using limited labeled data for accurate segmentation is our key concern. Methods: In this work, we propose a novel dual-consistency semi-supervised learning method for left atrium segmentation from 3D MR images. Our framework can effectively leverage limited labeled data and abundant unlabeled data by enforcing consistent predictions under model-level and structure-level perturbations. As for model-level perturbations, we employ a shared encoder and two slightly different decoders. Different decoders can output different predictions. As for structure-level spatial contextual perturbations, two sub-volumes with an overlapping region are randomly cropped, taking as inputs under different spatial contexts. Therefore, the proposed method can maintain the invariance of segmentation results when perturbed by different spatial contexts, and be robust to slight perturbations of networks. Results: Our method are evaluated on the public Atrial Segmentation Challenge dataset. The evaluation metrics of Dice, Jaccard, ASD and 95HD are 90.05%, 82.01%, 1.74 voxel and 7.03 voxel when we use 20% labeled data and 80% unlabeled data. The results show that the proposed method outperforms other exiting semi-supervised methods.

annotated samples that are high-cost and laborious. Semi-supervised image
segmentation can alleviate the problem by utilizing a large number of unlabeled
images along with limited labeled images. However, learning a robust
representation from numerous unlabeled images remains challenging due to
potential noise in pseudo labels and insufficient class separability in feature
space, which undermines the performance of current semi-supervised segmentation
approaches. To address the issues above, we propose a novel semi-supervised

Particularly, we design a novel rectification strategy for the pseudo
supervision method based on uncertainty estimation and consistency
regularization to reduce the noise influence in pseudo labels. Furthermore, we
introduce a bidirectional voxel contrastive loss to the network to ensure
intra-class consistency and inter-class contrast in feature space, which
increases class separability in the segmentation. The proposed RCPS

However, it is time-consuming and expensive for technicians to label medical images. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for semi-supervised medical image segmentation, named Uncertainty-aware Pseudo-label and Consistency. Our framework is made up of the student–teacher models. The supervised loss on labeled data and the consistency loss on both labeled and unlabeled data are weighted and combined to optimize the models. Our method combines the recent state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods, which are consistency regularization and pseudo-labeling. More importantly, we calculate the Kullback–Leibler variance between the student model’s prediction and the teacher model’s prediction as uncertainty estimation, and directly use the uncertainty to rectify the learning of noisy pseudo-labels, instead of setting a fixed threshold to filter the pseudo-labels. Experiments on the Left Atrium dataset show that our method can efficiently utilize unlabeled data to achieve high performance and outperform other state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods. In addition, we have also analyzed its difference from conventional methods of consistency regularization and pseudo-labeling in semi-supervised medical image segmentation.

Objective metrics that can collectively reflect the improvement in contrast and inadvertent distortions are necessary to rate the quality of enhanced images. The objective of this paper is to formulate an objective statistic for rating the quality of contrast enhancement on MR images and to test the agreement of the proposed metric with the subjective fidelity ratings. An objective metric named Cumulative Quality of Contrast-Enhanced Images (CQCEI), for assessing the quality of contrast enhancement, especially the performance of the histogram equalization and its variants, on MR images is proposed. The CQCEI is formulated such that it collectively accounts for various aspects of image quality pertaining to the contrast enhancement, namely improvement in contrast, shift in mean brightness, saturation and noise-amplification.

effectively exploit the unlabeled data for semi-supervised medical image
segmentation. The MC-Net+ model is motivated by the observation that deep
models trained with limited annotations are prone to output highly uncertain
and easily mis-classified predictions in the ambiguous regions (e.g., adhesive
edges or thin branches) for medical image segmentation. Leveraging these
challenging samples can make the semi-supervised segmentation model training
more effective. Therefore, our proposed MC-Net+ model consists of two new
designs. First, the model contains one shared encoder and multiple slightly
different decoders (i.e., using different up-sampling strategies). The
statistical discrepancy of multiple decoders' outputs is computed to denote the
model's uncertainty, which indicates the unlabeled hard regions. Second, we
apply a novel mutual consistency constraint between one decoder's probability
output and other decoders' soft pseudo labels. In this way, we minimize the
discrepancy of multiple outputs (i.e., the model uncertainty) during training
and force the model to generate invariant results in such challenging regions,
aiming at regularizing the model training. We compared the segmentation results
of our MC-Net+ model with five state-of-the-art semi-supervised approaches on
three public medical datasets. Extension experiments with two standard
semi-supervised settings demonstrate the superior performance of our model over
other methods, which sets a new state of the art for semi-supervised medical
image segmentation. Our code is released publicly at

segmentation of cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images. However, their
achievement is proving slow to transition to widespread use in medical clinics
because of robustness issues leading to low trust of clinicians to their
results. Predicting run-time quality of segmentation masks can be useful to
warn clinicians against poor results. Despite its importance, there are few
studies on this problem. To address this gap, we propose a quality control
method based on the agreement across decoders of a multi-view network, TMS-Net,
measured by the cosine similarity. The network takes three view inputs resliced
from the same 3D image along different axes. Different from previous multi-view
networks, TMS-Net has a single encoder and three decoders, leading to better
noise robustness, segmentation performance and run-time quality estimation in
our experiments on the segmentation of the left atrium on STACOM 2013 and
STACOM 2018 challenge datasets. We also present a way to generate poor
segmentation masks by using noisy images generated with engineered noise and
Rician noise to simulate undertraining, high anisotropy and poor imaging
settings problems. Our run-time quality estimation method show a good
classification of poor and good quality segmentation masks with an AUC reaching
to 0.97 on STACOM 2018. We believe that TMS-Net and our run-time quality
estimation method has a high potential to increase the thrust of clinicians to

from late gadolinium-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance (LGE CMR) images are
in high demand for quantifying atrial scars. The previous quantification of
atrial scars relies on a two-phase segmentation for LA and atrial scars due to
their large volume difference (unbalanced atrial targets). In this paper, we
propose an inter-cascade generative adversarial network, namely JAS-GAN, to
segment the unbalanced atrial targets from LGE CMR images automatically and
accurately in an end-to-end way. Firstly, JAS-GAN investigates an adaptive
attention cascade to automatically correlate the segmentation tasks of the
unbalanced atrial targets. The adaptive attention cascade mainly models the
inclusion relationship of the two unbalanced atrial targets, where the
estimated LA acts as the attention map to adaptively focus on the small atrial
scars roughly. Then, an adversarial regularization is applied to the
segmentation tasks of the unbalanced atrial targets for making a consistent
optimization. It mainly forces the estimated joint distribution of LA and
atrial scars to match the real ones. We evaluated the performance of our
JAS-GAN on a 3D LGE CMR dataset with 192 scans. Compared with the
state-of-the-art methods, our proposed approach yielded better segmentation
performance (Average Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) values of 0.946 and
0.821 for LA and atrial scars, respectively), which indicated the effectiveness
of our proposed approach for segmenting unbalanced atrial targets.",,,arXiv,,,2021-05-01,2021,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Chen, Jun; Yang, Guang; Khan, Habib; Zhang, Heye; Zhang, Yanping; Zhao, Shu; Mohiaddin, Raad; Wong, Tom; Firmin, David; Keegan, Jennifer","Chen, Jun (); Yang, Guang (); Khan, Habib (); Zhang, Heye (); Zhang, Yanping (); Zhao, Shu (); Mohiaddin, Raad (); Wong, Tom (); Firmin, David (); Keegan, Jennifer ()",,"Chen, Jun (); Yang, Guang (); Khan, Habib (); Zhang, Heye (); Zhang, Yanping (); Zhao, Shu (); Mohiaddin, Raad (); Wong, Tom (); Firmin, David (); Keegan, Jennifer ()",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1137748697,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4611 Machine Learning,

next generation of cognitive surgical assistance systems. These systems could
increase the safety of the operation through context-sensitive warnings and
semi-autonomous robotic assistance or improve training of surgeons via
data-driven feedback. In surgical workflow analysis up to 91% average precision
has been reported for phase recognition on an open data single-center dataset.
In this work we investigated the generalizability of phase recognition
algorithms in a multi-center setting including more difficult recognition tasks
such as surgical action and surgical skill. METHODS: To achieve this goal, a
dataset with 33 laparoscopic cholecystectomy videos from three surgical centers
with a total operation time of 22 hours was created. Labels included annotation
of seven surgical phases with 250 phase transitions, 5514 occurences of four
surgical actions, 6980 occurences of 21 surgical instruments from seven
instrument categories and 495 skill classifications in five skill dimensions.
The dataset was used in the 2019 Endoscopic Vision challenge, sub-challenge for
surgical workflow and skill analysis. Here, 12 teams submitted their machine
learning algorithms for recognition of phase, action, instrument and/or skill
assessment. RESULTS: F1-scores were achieved for phase recognition between
23.9% and 67.7% (n=9 teams), for instrument presence detection between 38.5%
and 63.8% (n=8 teams), but for action recognition only between 21.8% and 23.3%

  This paper aims to provide a systematic review on computing methods for LA
cavity, wall, scar and ablation gap segmentation and quantification from LGE
MRI, and the related literature for AF studies. Specifically, we first
summarize AF-related imaging techniques, particularly LGE MRI. Then, we review
the methodologies of the four computing tasks in detail, and summarize the
validation strategies applied in each task. Finally, the possible future
developments are outlined, with a brief survey on the potential clinical
applications of the aforementioned methods. The review shows that the research
into this topic is still in early stages. Although several methods have been
proposed, especially for LA segmentation, there is still large scope for
further algorithmic developments due to performance issues related to the high
variability of enhancement appearance and differences in image acquisition.",,,arXiv,,,2021-06-17,2021,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Li, Lei; Zimmer, Veronika A.; Schnabel, Julia A.; Zhuang, Xiahai","Li, Lei (); Zimmer, Veronika A.
